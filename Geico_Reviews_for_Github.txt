Driver of other was cited by police officer in traffic report for failure to yield and says that I have to file under my own and pay my own deductible because there is supposedly shared fault for the accident Accident report states the other driver stopped at stop light and proceeded to turn on the same road as my However my was nearly finished with the turn and was hit on back end back passenger door and quarter panel by the other driver's front end The other driver also had I should not have to pay a dollar deductible for driver's failure to yield as cited on the police report They state the other driver was almost complete with his turn How is that when his front end hit my rear passenger quarter panel when my was already on the road I hate this cheaper but heaven forbid the other driver carry They try their best to rule it this way so both drivers have to meet deductible 
 On Feb th I received a letter from that they had to drop me since I no longer had a driver's license However the was for my daughter's I had stopped driving so I put her and her name on policy She was years old I also had electronic funds transfer set up so the money came directly from my checking acct In the letter previously stated they they may be sending me a check for around Months later I a bill for Now my credit is messed up from this bill I never stopped payment on payments until today April Therefore I do not understand how they keep sending me to a credit bureau for this money They were able to take it out at any time when I had the yet they never did and I believe it is because they knew it was not theirs to be had I always paid even when I was not driving I have a letter from my bank stating that as of today I closed down the electronic transfer for And I did not close it before They had the opportunity to take payments as they have for years THANKS FOR THE FORUM  
  displayed very unprofessional and malicious character by withholding my legal rights to retain my totaled a Hyundai Sonata fully loaded at three months into the purchase My was in an accident on March leaving me mentally and physically upset and anguished Shortly after the accident decided to total the in no time days later March After repeatedly stating I want the totaled I instead preferred repairs for it representative stated each time when I requested how much the damages of the would cost she states “We are still working on the numbers but we are totaling the    She repeatedly states giving me RED FLAGS After waiting more days to my surprise the IAA salvage company calls me for permission to take the At this time we refused to give a verbal consent to release the until we received the estimates for the damages Meanwhile my belief is had no intentions of offering me my legal rights to keep my totaled and to allow a nd estimate for repairs March when reviewed the damages It was weeks later when Management assisted After the rd settlement was offered on March at no time was there any consideration shown or loyal customer service promised or an offer to repair up to the value of the damages why it was very important to have the cost of damages After the weeks the settlement was decided then j rental returned I located my at the salvage company The information disclosed on the salvage database included the sale of my for for the rear end damages decided to sell my to someone else received a payment the same amount that would have repaired my at my choice of shop The unethical way handled my property was for the benefit of the company instead of a loyal client This demonstrates poor customer service to the policyholder and the owner Knowing the was only months since purchased there was nothing wrong keeping the from being driven only the appearance nearly lost my job gained no money from as well as forced to search for to purchase This is severe mental anguish that should have been avoided if my rights and options had been disclosed to me from the beginning as professionals would do  
 Are negative stars possible I had for about a month My previous company sent a termination form to my state DMV when I switched coverage never sent an update that I had new with them making it look like I had no at all to my State I a letter from the DMV March saying they need to show I had no lapse in coverage or they would revoke my plates So I called to have them send the form they should have sent to begin with Beginning of March I left to go back to my previous when quadrupled my rate month into the policy with no tickets accidents changes to policy etc WHAT it I a letter saying that my rate would go from to over no explanation No brainer I went back to Progressive About weeks after having them send the form to the state I letter from the DMV saying I had week or my plates would be revoked because they had not received the FS form from I called and had them send the form AGAIN March and asked for a copy to be emailed to me they refused saying they could only send it in the mail which would be past the date of plate revocation April I patiently waited on my mailed copy which arrived the day after my plates were revoked I called the DMV they still had not received the letter from I asked if I could bring in my copy when I noticed that the person who sent it had inverted the inception and termination dates showing that the policy was terminated before it ever began The DMV refused to take it I called a third time to a corrected FS form and have them fax it directly to the DMV agent I was working with and send me a copy still waiting for my copy of course Does it matter No we are way past the DMV deadline I have to wait a few days to verify with the DMV that this has been done correctly for the third time *meanwhile now April th and I cannot drive to work the grocery store etc because MY PLATES HAVE BEEN REVOKED and I a ticket if pulled over Thanks I never be a customer again and be sure to tell my friends and family about the terrible service and experience I have had Fifteen minutes save you % or more No Progressive is the price of Not to mention the six weeks of trying to you to send a simple FS to my DMV so that my plates revoked and still waiting on that to be resolved And I drive my furious a terrible company  
 Well I went ahead and put my application for auto and home with I paid both for year I decided to go into First Security for my homeowner's that hook me up with Well what a disaster I into this site for four months All that kept saying was site's down so I called and complained The customer service horrendous They had no answers They kept saying   Oh you do it on a tablet    What a crock been on this tablet for years and I never had a problem Come to learn it was not the tablet it was First Security give me any answers They as bad as First Security I know why people even use them They know very little of nothing Finally I the rep   Mail me out the policy because I see if anything changed    She   You upload it    I     I tell you the site's down    She's   Okay send it to in a email    funny how they it but I and I am the paying customer Is that a joke or what I definitely look somewhere else for and homeowners coverage I want to do business with people that allow me to see what spending my money on and then when you call them they have no answers then I have to call for my homeowner's What the heck is that No I want to speak directly to the company I am doing business with been spinning my wheels for the past weeks try to an answer person knows less than the other They may sell a lot of but they sure know how to run a business joke Why would I let them choose a homeowner's company for me They should be a drop down box that I choose  
 I have been a customer for about ten years now with never any issues however this month they informed me that they are to raise my rates substantially over a month more For their justification they listed separate instances over the past years was understandably an at fault accident with of my kids but the other were no fault accidents that even involve them the other company accepted full liability and paid in full Their reasoning is that if you have that many occurrences in that period of time statistically you are more likely to into additional accidents That logic would hold up if they were at fault accidents I have lost all respect for these people and I strongly discourage anyone from doing business with these people  
 I was in a accident nearly a year ago I did not think it was my fault but refused to investigate even though there was a video tape available They did not bother the video tape I took my for a damage estimate and was given a check Soon after the adjuster called me stating I should not cash it because it should be made out to me and not to me and the bank financing the The was already paid for and the check had been made out to me I this to the adjuster but she would not listen and cancelled the check anyway In through my records I found that had given me a check for which I had never cashed I asked them to re issue the check and they they would Nearly a year later I still have the check or the for my repairs did send me a check for the repairs but I did not cash it right away because I kept waiting for the other check so I could use both to pay This because I had a deductible so the check they gave me did not cover all the repairs and I need the check to help Then I a call from the adjuster stating they would reissue the check they had sent me because it was probably no good anymore The check was good but that was canceled anyway Then adjuster called me and stated she could not re issue the check because it had to be made out to both me and the bank This is the exact opposite of what she me not to cash the first check By now I was fed up with all this and the adjuster to send me the check or I would file a complaint Today I the check in the mail and it was made out to the bank and not to me No promises of the check were ever kept Their stories keep changing and I believe they are lying to me and trying to out of paying me Three times they promised to send the check and never did I am very disgusted and frustrated and I put in a call to a lawyer and waiting to hear back  
 Verna and I were driving in a San Luis Obispo shopping mall parking lot with our Volvo V wagon and was hit in the rear right wheel fender area from a women backing out of her parking space The damage was Ameriprise from Costco represented us for a claim for reimbursement Our rental charge during repair was and the at fault driver's carrier claims the at fault driver had only public property damage of Hence a pro rated amount of only was awarded We claim since we were not at fault the amount owed should be could raise the at fault driver's premium or invoice her to fully reimburse us Pursuing in small claims court is not practical The release of funds letter was signed and mailed by us but no funds have been received to date  
  has some of the worst customer service I have ever come across I recently signed up with about a month ago I was in the process of the money to pay my next bill and ended up breaking my leg So after having to deal with bills piling up on me canceled my policy and instead of being willing to help me out they decide to charge me more I never do business with again This is supposed to be of the biggest companies out there but a joke rip off Poor customer service  
 In March an claim was filed with after a policy holder struck my The claim was submitted so that could cover costs associated with damage to my The damage occurred when a driver made in improper lane change and struck my To assist with the handling of my claim I provided with a copy of the Georgia Uniform Accident Report where the officer confirmed that an improper lane change occurred The police report noted that the driver was issued a citation for failure to maintain lane improper lane change I also provided with photographs of damage to each photographs of the scene and an aerial view of the accident site Several days later a Claims Adjuster called me and stated that not accept liability for the damage caused by the driver of the insured They stated that the driver provided a version of the accident that is contrary to my statement of facts and facts stated in the police report They their decision to deny liability was based on their review of all information and the point of impact They stated that only use accident reports as a tool and have not used facts within it as a basis to accept liability However they have provided no tangible basis for their denial of liability they provided no evidence to support a contrary view of facts surrounding the accident they apparently did not utilize a trained accident investigator and they appear to have relied on lies by the driver as a way to avoid paying a legitimate claim against their insured I have heard that many policyholders have had similar experiences For these reasons I believe has engaged in unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices and has acted in bad faith Do yourself your friends and your family a favor and let everyone know why not to do business with them You may save a few dollars month upfront but I assure you it cost you much more in the long run  
 My husband and I have had for a number of years with no accidents Our teenage son became a driver and speeding tickets We expected a rate increase but dropped us with weeks warning After paying this company many thousands of dollars over the years without any claims I found this absurd companies make a hearty profit to take on risks then drop people once risk is in sight Seriously Americans need to start demanding decent service for our hard earned money Never ever we go back to and if you are shopping around for right now stay away far away from this company  
 I urge that you obtain coverage from a company that treats their customers with respect Worst Do Not unless you never plan to have someone hit you So where do I even begin Let's first start with the fact that I filed a claim after my was totaled in March with a police report showing the other driver is at fault I filed the claim right away and I uploaded all pictures and evidence I have and nobody reviewed it called them times and every time I call a new person and nobody knows anything I was assigned a claim specialist from my that never even returned my phone calls Nobody has called me but the person that looked at the he want to tow the so they have to pay storage fees and force me to agree to their value The website app you submit your stuff to I submitted my pictures I think any body even looks at it Every time you call a new person that answers the phone and asks you the same questions over and over again back to step Since it our fault I was waiting for the other to pay and closed the claim but it looks like was to take longer so I decided to have my pay and cover the claim at the meantime and later they request to be paid back from the other I had adjuster came from the other to evaluate my a lot faster than my However my also sent out an adjuster to evaluate the finally after weeks and their evaluation was almost lower than the other I tried to more details from the my own appraiser but instead of help I was beating by them My daughter was dealing with an adjuster from His name Nicholas ** He basically gave my daughter the total and I do anything about it not helpful at all So we asked for his supervisor's name and phone and he did provide me with his supervisor name and phone Jason ** And when I called him this is when I was shocked by the way he handle my call unprofessional and my question to now   if this is of the management team how is the rest of the team    Jason even listen to me so he understand my question to him but he kept talking over me and not letting me finish my sentence I would recommend to provide more training to their employees especially if they have a management title This is look super bad and I would never recommend to anyone When they say you what you pay for well is like the menu at MacD but you have to pull it out of the ground wash it cut it cook it wait give % of it back to them You are better off paying a bit more let the little green lizard sell you is HORRIBLE I forgot to mention too the Auto Damage Supervisor Jason was taking advantage and discriminating since my English was not perfect Shame on you  
 I decided to switch my auto back to since State Farm went up a whole extra So I give a called and the representative give me an amazing full coverage deal of a month and I live in NYC I was rather surprise and ask him to list what's included in my policy so I may compare it to State Farm Everything checked out fine I proceeded to print my cards and wait for my package in my mail Two months later still receive anything so I tried logging into the site only to find out that my policy be cancelled within a month so I called They claim that they had sent out a questionnaire that had to be answered and returned within a certain amount of days I explained to them that I received anything at all from in the mail period They had no intentions of sending me questionnaire until I brought up the fact that I would contact their corporate office They fax me over the questionnaire which I was unable to read because of the clarity I called and explained that I could hardly read what's on the questionnaire which they claim once again that not allowed to fax over more than once so I brought up corporate office yet again and this time I was faxed over the papers I needed that happen to be in perfect order I filled the papers out and fax it back to only to receive a call the following day saying that my policy still be cancelled I ask why and they stated that the information I provided when I signed up was different from the answers on the questionnaire which I them was a lie I them to listen to the phone call and they hear everything I stated is the same as the answers on the questionnaire The representative not every call is recorded and even if my call was recorded it would have been deleted by now so I have to take her word that my information I provided was inconsistent with each other That really annoyed me cause I know lying for a fact and even tell me what part was inconsistent so about to file a complaint trust at all  
 I had auto with for years but did not know of their 'partnering' with other organizations and the discounts they provide I had not been asked about these organizations to see if I qualified So I overpaid for years Recently I asked for a quote After years I finally left to go to less expensive company and the quote from with the discounts was about less than previously However I was not able to a credit as they only give it within days In addition I found the service people wasted a lot of my time and I nowhere trying to information and trying to hurry up the process  
 I was struck on my scooter by a member The adjustment quotes I received not only fail to provide an equal replacement they are actually an   insult   to the victim of the accident While that the adjustments were made by a rd party to ensure   impartiality   the truth is this rd party in partnership w including its own adjustment factors simply cranks numbers based upon a year and mileage of a w out any consideration of a the condition in which it was kept AND b the victim's ability to find an equal replacement within a reasonable distance of the community So here we have a multi billion company w its popular gecko scamming the victims of its customer's accidents versus displaying full integrity and consideration to ensure they are provided with a that reasonably provides equal value and comfort INDEED if correct this review tops now a list of # others mostly negative Shame on  
I was on the highway and was hit from behind I was % not at fault My was and this is the first accident I have ever been in It was impossible to a claims adjuster on the phone which I had for years treated me like I was bothering them would not give me any advice Also never once made me feel like they cared The at fault was Safeco and I was treated so well Amanda the adjuster was very nice and really cared for my claim I never use again Accidents happen and your company should be the to help you and make you feel like a person 
 They do not fight for you They determined an accident was mine when my was parked they are paying for damage to a man's that I did not do Do not use I report please run and a company that fight for you and do what is right Again my was parked and they are saying it was my fault  
 I have used for years Two years ago I had a minor no fault fender bender and used for that I asked them carefully how much a claim would impact my rates and they due to my longevity it would not raise my rates During my recent experience I found out it did I called in to let know I was moving back to CA from Illinois in days and would need a policy change I the agent I had a permanent address in CA At that he began to change the policy to CA that minute though the was not yet here At the same time he let me know that the CA rate which was around when I had it last would now be and that was a combo of rate increases in CA and a change due to my claim So I would now be paying an extra + over the Illinois policy But be that as it may I had asked him not to start it immediately anyway that it would be the end of the month before the was here But then here's the unbelievable part he he did not believe me and then started to go ahead and set up the CA policy I was telling him no no no and then in despair I hung and called back to try to someone else Meanwhile he had finished setting up the CA policy and I no longer had an Illinois policy And the is still there and Illinois laws are easily as tough as CA Needless to say I cancelled and new with company However in my conversations with not rep even understood what I was saying and each the sales rep was within his rights to close my Illinois policy and open in CA because he had essentially 'caught me lying' My own impression was that he was partially napping through most of my into speech about how I was here and the yet This was a nightmare Of course they cannot open a new policy for me to 'teach me a lesson' though they could have refused me service or something I must say it was the most astonishing and weird experience ever had with a company Did Trump buy out for of his kids  
Please Stay away from There is no customer service who listen to you Your first bill be very cheap then they double your bill If you accident never pay you They salvage your They put wrong mileage Websites does very cheap There is no office to go Please do not put your or your house or anything with You cry night and day and they not listen to you They charge you double and double 
 On I was rear ended by a drunk driver The driver refused to stop I chased down the long enough to the license number I went home and called the police and made out a report I reported this to claimed there was nothing they could do that I had to the police report and find the other driver's company and contact that company I paid for the police report and called the other driver's company Farmers Farmers while their insured hit me the police report fault could not be determined Nick ** of intervened and me Farmers claimed their insured never hit me and he could not compel the other driver to compare the damage on my to that of the other despite the police report indicating the damage to the other seemed consistent with the damage to mine Nick ** me could not represent me that I would have to go after the other driver on my own  
I needed reasonable and necessary medical treatment for a headache and pinched up back after being rear ended and they there was not enough damage to need any medical treatment and did not pay my claim I have contacted the Ohio Dept of Ins and feel like this review needs to be written as well Claims service is quite poor and furthermore the claims adjuster was short and rude with me too 
 ran my credit without authorization and a class action law suit should and be brought against them for unfair business practices and consumer fraud I the representative that under no circumstances were they allowed to pull my credit because the initial quote was outrageously high I terminated the call and found out a week later that they violated my privacy 
We have a small bit of damage on our and called to ask about whether a claim would raise our rates I was informed by a Thomas that he was now obliged to report my information to the Claims Department and a rate increase could occur based on my call I do think a consumer should be able to call a company to ask a question without a rate increase resulting from a hypothetical situation Not asking too much 
 My was totaled in January and was great in their initial response when I filed a claim with them I was very pleased and thankful and almost filled out their customer survey they sent out asking about my claim experience in that first week but decided to wait until it was done I was delayed in them title since I was out of the country but did it as soon as I back to the USA I was quoted the same price for the payout after my deductible on separate occasion by two different employees A month after they received my title and two phone calls from me later to try and figure out what was happening I received a payment that was close to less than what I had been quoted separate times with absolutely no explanation It took me phone calls of varying lengths and aggravation and over two weeks to finally to agree to pay me the amount that THEY had determined my was worth i e the number that they came up with not me I was also that they adjusted the amount AFTER they had received my title When I first confronted them about the difference they were apologetic but seemed unwilling to adjust the amount to what they originally quoted It was after a stern conversation and bringing up the possibility of opening a complaint with the Department of Licensing and consulting with a lawyer that they took action to honor their original amount  
A customer of was at fault in running into my from the back Customer he would pay out of pocket but I his and DR in case Customer now refuses to pay so I contacted because we did not a police report that they not pay even though I have his and DR picture So how you % off Now I have to sue customer for expenses incurred ** 
 Warning using your consumer compare quote info and change your policy and profile before ever speaking with you DO NOT DO AN ONLINE QUOTE THEY USE AGAINST YOU EVEN IF YOU ARE AN IDEA OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS They added a driver a and changed my marital status and household info without ever speaking to me off a private quote comparison be warned   Your Attention Required The driver's license number for ** is missing Please take a moment to update this information now Failure to provide this information may result in the cancellation of your policy    They are collecting and using everything you input against you and could be far worse for other folks I have been with the over yrs I no longer trust them with my information  
 So I bought an auto policy that required special verbiage I was by the sales rep that this be a problem Once I received the paid policy it include the verbiage I needed After multiple phone calls and speaking with several people I was the sales rep was wrong and they be able to supply what I needed Ok fine coverage with company and things be great so I thought I was then by the canceling agent that I would only receive back instead of the initial deposit of What The policy even been in effect for hours and it was their fault due to misinformation given by their sales rep still on the phone waiting for a supervisor to hopefully my money back Stay away from this company  
 Pretty upset in regards to the non service I received this morning I was under the assumption I had ERA However after calling they confirmed I after telling them my battery is completely dead and I had no way of help So I went ahead and added the additional service on in the same phone call I also went ahead and asked   Since I added this on you please send someone out to help me    And they refused to help me because it was a preexisting condition and stated I would have to pay out of pocket How messed up I added the service on in the same phone call that I made telling them stuck and they make any exemptions To me pretty poor customer service  
  I had a policy and kept up my payments on time auto enrolled I asked a week ago to cancel the policy and they me yes Today I open my email and they have my charge of over dollars and I called for a refund They only give back less than half For I had dropped and it was paid up To me this is wrong They are not to be trusted  
 On Saturday morning December about am I had a problem with my Since we had a lot of rain for a few days in San Antonio it was a lot of water on the roads After a couple days riding back and forth in the rain and high water my engine lights came on and the cover underneath the came off and was dragging I was stuck Some passersby helped me by pulling my home since I was only about and a half miles away When I home I called to make a Claim for flood damage I was they were having problems with their system and it would take to hrs someone would contact me back Tuesday I still heard anything so I called them They they would the Claim Adjuster out asap so we started with Claim They asked for police report or if I had it towed Like I them when I called call them since I have a collision the police out for any nonemergency you to wait a long time since a lot of major accidents and all because of the weather I them Saturday when I called I call them to do a report and they     worry about it Now ok    Their calls are recorded Now they telling me I should of Wow Meantime they they a Claim Adjuster out to me She finally came out Thursday afternoon She was that when the bottom came off my dash lights lit up and I was horrible noises from my engine She looked at the bottom damage and did her estimate from that I had to call her to find out that all she was by I her the water did damage to my engine or something my lights were on She to have it taken to a shop and they do a estimate from there In the meantime I missed days of work not being able to there cause they ok me to a rental I them missing work and I around Still it matter Friday the is towed to shop I waited hours to hear back About pm I called Claim Adjuster back to see if I a rental and she   Let me see what's the hold up I call you back    Never did Here it is Saturday again and I been spending money on rides trying to around with my kids I called to see if I a rental They they finished my process yet and know yet if they to pay the Claim What I called the claims complaint department to complain I never my calls back I was hrs when I first filed If I call them I a callback The claims complaint department was not helpful either All they was a process I pay for full coverage and rental but stuck with no Missing a lot of work Might lose my job my kids around Almost out of money and they know if they are even to pay for damages You think covered but up to them to say if you are Me I have to wait and see whenever they to me  
   let the cute lizard fool you inexplicably held up closing an auto accident claim that they were to be reimbursed for by the person at fault's company We that we were through with treatment claims and they sent us threatening letters and mail concerning a medical review from a doctor whose reviews online were very bad This was even though we them a number of times that we were done and they should submit the medical claims to the other company for payment reimbursement Because of this terrible claims handling experience we decided to terminate our coverage with and go with company also saving about a year for better coverage When I called to cancel the guy kept trying to sell me and it done I finally asked to speak with his supervisor and he he have one I called back and asked rep to put me in touch with the first Guy's supervisor Left a voicemail and received no response twice Worst customer service experienced with any company for a long time Comcast customer service is better  
My son into a accident and immediately assumed that my son was on a job at the time and refused to pay for the claim They also advised the other driver to file a law suit against me instead to me to pay for the accident It was a minor scratch on the bumper and this is the service I am from 
Their customer service has always been good quality Also the claims process went really quickly And they seem judgmental when doing so Coverage was average and was comparable to any other company out there Basically you what you pay for as far as coverage I was on the lower end of coverage opting not to pay more They more than tripled my rate from year to the next after an entire year with no claims No reason for it No explanations it is what it is So I left and went with Progressive who gave me the same coverage for lower rates Their customer service was always friendly and nonjudgemental Also efficient in handling claims and fielding questions Customer service was never an issue tripling my rates after I had been a loyal customer for years is a huge issue 
I have been with for years They pull my payment out of my account They cause my account to go into Neg by trying pull whole premium out and additional fees My bank froze the account and then my bank closed my account altogether They say they cancel the policy they still after policy cancelled still continued to try to pull payment out Why payment then say date I had and then back date it so it looks like I been without for a month Customer Service Amanda me they would give me a refund and my policy cancel the next month But then back dated it so to say because been a month We give you full coverage Then send me a letter stating I requested to come out of Autopay and I So I called and then find out for a month the been cancel I call They tell me I have to pay payments to restarted only find out they lied after I made payment They say they only give me liability knowing dang well I have to have full coverage They care about years you been money If you ask for Supervisor you ahead floor walking supervisor at the call center They all trained to do thing SAVE MONEY and MONEY 
I am canceling today for the second time I am so sick of how my husband and I were treated involving a claim Not only have several agents contacted us saying different things but now an investigator wants to be involved How come I my damn fixed Was supposed to quote on damage Thursday but it all came to a screeching halt today as they wanna be ** about it I feel we were treated unfairly and possibly discriminated against as my husband is unemployed They are drastically different from State Farm and suck so much worse Claims with state farm were a lot more professional and friendly This company treated us horrible I recommend to anyone They make fixing your in a timely manner almost impossible and treat you like a criminal at the same time 
 Too bad no option for ZERO stars on this review site I had the great misfortune of having two seriously damaged by drivers in the past days Dealing with them has been nothing short of a nightmare In the first instance the driver of a rented Budget truck who is insured by and had waived in writing any right to any extra property damage through Budget backed onto my private property and hit my parked doing worth of damage and rendering the undrivable That was Oct now December and I have yet to receive a check for damages so I repair my which WAS for sale when hit After weeks of   investigation   to try to figure out how they could squirm out of paying my claim a adjuster did finally come to my home to inspect the and provide a written estimate But no money changed hands   Ordinarily    she   I'd give you a check on the spot but my printer working    That was two weeks ago In the interim three different employees have given me at least four different dates when my elusive claims check was supposedly written and mailed All lies apparently because to date my mailbox is still empty To add insult to injury about three weeks after this incident I was broadsided by driver who ran his junk heap of a straight through a stop sign To my knowledge no adjuster ever bothered to view my after it was towed to the body shop for the more than in necessary repairs If they had they would easily have seen that I was of the way through the intersection when their driver hit me Still despite interviewing two witnesses both agents who were directly behind the other driver and corroborated that he was % at fault only agreed to pay % of the claim When informing me of their decision they sent a letter addressing me like a driver's ed student advising me in detail how I could have more safely navigated the intersection to avoid the accident I found that pretty infuriating considering that lived less than a mile from this particular crossing for over years and have driven through it no less than previous times without incident The most troubling fact about all of this is that according to my own claims person now routine for to assign some percentage of blame on the other party in almost every accident involving of their drivers Quite a crafty business practice given that their probably incentivized claims people know exactly what figure they away with without fear of being taken to arbitration It may be a few hundred dollars per claim but when you add it all up at the end of the day these shady cost shaving maneuvers save millions of dollars a year on liability claims they ethically should be pay out but No wonder billionaire Warren Buffett views the company as a jewel in the crown of his Berkshire Hathaway holdings and why he pays CEO many millions of dollars a year in compensation believe the hype about this hypocrite businessman who claims to care about the little guy In reality he and his cronies happily put their hands in your pocket and anyone's else's as long as they end up a few bucks ahead If anyone knows of any class action lawsuits against this company I would LOVE to on board  
I requested a quote at an address in Michigan Was to see the price difference before making final plans to move The locked me out of my account and automatically changed my policy to a MI policy from a GA policy without my saying to do so There was a huge price difference and they now say they change it back without verifying my residence They verify anything to switch it and even tell me they did so They also that switch it on the th if they hear back from me At that point they had already switched the policy I have all the calls recorded and find it appalling that they are so crooked to lie like that I would never recommend trusting again so many bad reviews only thankful I never had to deal with the horrific claims department I have read so much about Thank you Lord I normally post bad reviews but in this case they need to be blasted on their blatant dishonesty with changing my policy without approval 
 I went onto the website and a quote for and some cents Then I went forward and tried to start the policy When I pushed for the policy the amount JUMPED to something I had asked for my account to be charged on December th for the policy to start after I immediately called seeing this extorted rate They informed me that they immediately charged my account on December nd for the higher amount and I would have to wait business days to a refund The lady then very rude with me and actually started talking slowly to me I then asked for a supervisor and he was able to cancel the payment It was a horrible ordeal and I would never recommend  
 I had no trouble with my claim except that it took a very long time to pay my claim Almost a month and I at fault I was making a legal turn and the other driver hit me I bought over the legal minimum and the price was decent The purchase of the was handled entirely by phone with no service at a local office By having the I was able to obey the law and when my was totaled in an accident I was able to replace it even though it took a very long time to pay my claim Until my was canceled my customer service experience was satisfactory While everything was handled by phone or mail I would recommend that possible customers only purchase from an agent with a local office  
 Involved in an auto accident other party was at fault I paid my deductible up front so I did not have to wait to have my repaired It has been months and has continued to give me the run around with refunding my deductible Sylvia ** in subrogation me I had the choice to choose a deductible whose team is on In addition to that refused to cover my brake caliper that was clearly caused by a semi truck backing up into my I cannot wait to stop horrible piss poor service  
Every year this company nickel and dimes you to death Rates go up for no reason Even ALLSTATE is cheaper than This company is a big scam I would hate to see if I into a wreck My good rates would climb for sure 
 I've had for many years but never had to use their services Until I into an accident that was clearly the other vehicle's fault which happens to have as well decided that the accident was no one's fault since we both had different stories Which is stupid cause if they did an investigation it would have clearly been the other driver's fault They considered my Jeep a total loss and gave me a measly for it In the meantime it took them over months to this money I provided a rental because it was up to the other provider to do that WHICH WAS Every time I called I had to explain the situation over and over no seemed to want to help They kept tossing me to the agents that never picked up I ended up dropping them after this and went to State Farm which was way cheaper So far so good let's see how they act when an accident happens  
 I was rear ended by a driver while parking causing obvious damage to the rear driver's side quarter panel of my truck and damage to the front of his I had two witnesses that were unrelated to me agree to speak with the police and They never were contacted I spoke with the agent reviewing my claim and she had come to her conclusion that we were both at fault and they were to pay the claim to his from her observations on Google Earth When I asked her if she looked at when the image was captured by Google Earth and if she was aware that the street may have changed since that point I received no explanation She never went to the scene of the accident in person Denver CO nor did she inspect the damage on my or the other involved in the accident It was determined from an Internet satellite image from her desk in Texas Ridiculous This should have been cut and dry Besides the obvious location of the damage it was clear I was not at fault unless my truck drive sideways I also had two witnesses say he obviously annoyed and impatient and attempted to aggressively pass me and have enough room When I called to speak with her manager I had much trouble reaching him personally and left three messages I a call back after the third message and almost two weeks but I home so he left a message stating   he was sorry for my experience and would take care of this   After that I made calls to him on about five more occasions each time reaching only his voicemail When I tried number out of desperation I was he was gone on vacation Never heard back Their lack of effort concern and acceptable investigative process left me with my first accident in my years of driving is horrible do not use them now with State Farm and very satisfied with their personal service  
 I was insured with and things was great until now that I had been treated for my neck and upper part due my accident in March th It was snowing that day and the road was bad I went off the road and my went debris was on the side of the road and caused damaged to the lower front part of the It affected my radiation It was leaking and some other damages it was a sudden moment and I tried to control the from falling in the ditch I fell forward backwards and side ways during the time of the accident Banging my head against the window and the wheel I go to the hospital immediately until later on in a month I felt pain on my neck left side and constant headache After different MRI at the Providence they find anything but my pain was worse I thought I might had a stroke and check back in at the emergency They run tests and find nothing I decided to visit the Chiropractor for adjustment after few visits at the Providence and I was still in pain constantly I used cold pack ice heating pads daily was my only reliever After my first visit with Dr ** Chiropractor with adjustment therapy and massage my headache disappeared and I was able to move around freely and sit up longer Well my medical charge was sent to and they refuse to pay and the next thing I know they dropped my they send me to their own Doctor for review I receive a certified letter from the Adjuster Brian ** They are evaluation my claim at the meantime I contacted twice on their ** csr ** csr Both of them me Mgr Tim ** suppose to call me After waiting for two weeks Tim ** call me today at am Alaska time He me he send me a letter over weeks cancel my policy due to my high charge of my medical bills from Dr ** Chiropractor I him I have not received the letter He continued to tell me it was send over weeks After few minutes I him I was driving my for weeks without coverage If I would in an accident I could in trouble because I know they drop my I also asked him if this was legal He he become irate and defensive then hung up He argued he send a letter via registered and I repeated I never receive any letter from him or Before he hung up I him I see him in court I feel that was not legal of them to refuse to pay my bill due to my accident After raising his voice and been defensive he hung up I am very unhappy with this company I probably take them to court I paid the most high money for my policy and they drop me because my medical was too high I paid the highest medical in my policy I continue this complain if I have to write Congress about my problem they need to be of their poor service and rude unqualified employees

 I am a previous customer of years without any accidents and a perfect driving record My first accident was hitting a pothole in the freeway in the middle of the night causing some major rear end damage me it was a DOT issue and they would not cover it After months of back and forth I dropped and left the as a repossession  
  has been my company for more than years and all of a sudden they decided to raise my rates a month for no reason at all I never had an accident or anything in my record for them to raise my rates out of the blue I called them separates times hoping it would resolved but instead they made up some excuse about my position changing at work I have never changed my position or at least for the past years The last person that I was   lucky   to be a discount for being something I am not and also lucky because I need to pay back pay for the   great deal   I was for years This is so outrageous that I prefer to pay the same or more and move to company I feel very disrespected I hope this message to as many people as it to open their eyes to the horrible unfair and dishonest treatment gives its most loyal customers  
 On our Pontiac Vibe was involved in a accident where my husband sustained injuries sent an adjuster to our home where he says our dollars Pontiac Vibe was totaled at the Claim Check Amount of This amount was given to a lien holder instead We had to a lawyer to receive any payout from continues to run those   false advertisement ads   on television radio internet and etc My advice to any family members workmates neighbors or friends please cancel any policies you may have with They pay if you have an accident or any other mishap We were insured by them for five years without missing any premium payments in the process company is deceitful in its practices towards their policyholders They continually embezzle your monthly premium payments and have no intentions on making payments to your claims Drop immediately It is now November and our attorney received any payment from even after my husband and I attended their Examination Under Oath Nothing have we received and we are desperate for funds to purchase

 Having a comprehensive supposed to make me feel my is protected from vandalism as what promised to do in my policy In good faith trusted them until my recent vandalism claim a month ago Claim taken legitimized reviewed confirmed acknowledged by a adjuster as I had brought my in for inspection and was advised to go to any body shop of my choice Did exactly what they've advised me and the inconsistency occurred at the body repair shop I picked Part of my initial claim was my key that has been compromised and needed a replacement Now denying it as not part of the claim while everything is documented even in my online account in reference to the claim The initial adjuster tossed my claim to field adjuster that now denying that my key was never added as part of the claim Now furious with adjuster who should've handled the completeness of claim in the first place that my key replacement has been part of the entire claim My claim is still open and my is currently in the shop for repairs Now pissed and stressing out on how to rectify this issue with I emailed and called the primary adjuster to follow through his failure to have documented the completeness of the claim from day regardless who handles it after him My advice to whoever reading this and consider as your next I highly disprove and not recommend them at all Not only they only take your money handling claims with them give you hell I look for and definitely change company as soon as my claim is all settled and taken care of

  threatened my wife with cancelling her policy on because of a suspension of a license in a state she own Even though had her official driver's license from a different state they repeatedly sent her threatening emails and letters that her license had been suspended from a state she live in and then when we called they accused her of lying treated her as a criminal cancelled the automatic payment but then kept the even though THEY cancelled the policy absolutely crooks never again But on a more positive note this forced us to shop around for decent which we found % less in premiums with MORE coverage Goodbye false advertising only goes so far

 I am very dissatisfied with the service received as a result of this automobile incident On the morning of at am your insurer ran into my Chevrolet Impala North Charleston Police unit responded to this incident At the conclusion your insurer was found at fault and cited for this incident and received my court date of I reported the incident to my carrier using the number listed on my card The customer service agent asked about the police report At that time the office had not arrived on the scene She informed me to call back when I received the police report I called back with the police report in hand I was instructed to report to the nearest office located at Rivers Avenue North Charleston SC I arrived at this location later on When I walked in the receptionist offered to help I explained that I was involved in an automobile incident earlier that morning I informed her I left the emergency room I explained to her that the police officer informed me to turn the report in to my company no later than days Also the representative at the number also instructed me to do the same The receptionist made a copy of the report She kept the original and gave me the copied report week later I contacted at the for an update on my claim At that time I was informed the police report was not attached to my claim policy On I received an estimate of to repair my On I spoke with my claim worker She informed me she still had not received the police report faxed to her from my local office Thus she had no idea who was at fault for the incident She asked if my was repaired I explained the was somewhat operable She informed me that I could take my to the body shop and that I would a rental during the repair – because I had collision on my policy On I paid Kings Auto Repair to tow my to their repair shop My claim worker sent me to Enterprise Rental to retrieve my day rental On I received a check from in the amount of Within days my repairs were complete I took the body shop my check for I was informed that my repairs were Therefore I did not have enough money to my out the shop On I went to the Chiropractor for my minor issues My daughter and I were we would have to pay out of pockets for these visits because MY policy wouldn’t cover it My policy should not be used in the claim since your insurer was found at fault and cited On the judge found me NOT GUILTY for this incident The judge found your insurer guilty of all charges and fined I explained this to my claims representative I questioned why MY policy was being used to pay for repairs when I was not at fault I questioned why I had to pay of my claim money to pay my deductible This is not professional This is not acceptable The other driver was fully insured with Why is my policy being used when I was not found at fault and his policy number is listed on the policy report I never refer people to This has been the most stressful time of my life  
 I am not a customer I was involved with an accident with of adjuster me they pay for the seat as long as I have concern about it Because they are they are nice It is not required by the law Blah Blah Blah send them the receipt They pay Sounds great right So I happily buy a new seat and throw away the old one then send receipt did not hear anything from for weeks then I send a message to ask finally called and ask for picture to show the damage WTF This is not the first time they do this to me They did not disclose about if I use their bodyshop they not pay for value lost They promise to pay times I spend on the hospital visit then bait me to drop the medical claim Stay away from  
 Cheats inadequate and thieves Mind you had for over years This last few years they are on my nerves They keep adding on rental coverage without permission and they change the miles to and from work on my policy without asking I called a few months ago and removed my grand daughter from my policy only to see they slipped her back on without telling me Lastly they would not come out and look at my when I had an accident The person who hit me lied about what happened and both parties were using They had agent say it my husband's fault and the other state it was So if my husband wanted his fixed he would have to pay the deductible to it fixed What a waste of our money This person hit our ran my husband had to stop her and then lied about what happened and if would off their ass and come look at the physical evidence they would see she was lying But they bother Goodbye  
 I am acting as a authorized rep for my yr old parent October she was involved in an auto accident which required days of hospitalization reps have continuously failed to process claim months later we sit with an open claim and service reps who refused to work diligently and pay claims to all providers I receive monthly phone calls from allstate the nd party's ins co They have offered a settlement but we are at a standstill as reps are not capable of accomplishing a payment summary with a zero balance My question is this How many Seniors who live alone and do not have family to work on their behalf are caught in a sewer of discrimination reps should be ashamed that they treat those living out their golden years AND PAYING ESCALATING PREMIUMS ON TIME as less than secondary citizens I continue the fight for my parent but who work for those who are alone NOT  
 My major complaint is If you are to add a driver to my policy or give a rate increase you Better notify me in writing notifying me of the changes and when they be in effect I did not receive this until after I cancelled with The only thing I received was a cancellation letter for payment not received and I needed to pay a certain amount before being cancelled I called and set up the payment since this amount was larger than I normally pay I thought I behind since I was in the hospital it could have been my oversight After making the payment with the customer service representative he says to me   ok now your next payment due is due in two weeks    flabbergasted What happened to my account What changed The representative me I made the change Yes in fact I removed a from the policy two days prior So that increases my policy by in month He then tells me I added my son to the policy which I They did automatically Hence an increase of since he is a new driver Here the catch He has his own and went out and bought a brand new Motorcycle He lives with us so I still have to have him on my policy It matter if he has his own It has to be auto He own a automobile but according to if your kids live with you they have the ability to drive your I have two other sons as well They have the ability to drive my too however they are covered and I do not need to add them to my policy My husband and I have a great driving record so this was bogus has a policy that if you have a child that is a new driver they have to be covered on your policy regardless if they have their own unless you prove they live with you I went around and around with the representative as he contradicted himself several times Ok so he needs auto and he be removed from my policy   Yes provide a letter    Next he was telling me my new hypothetical rate since I had to this letter for them Next   well he still lives with you so what do you want him assigned to      Excuse me we went over this None He has his own    I finally ended the call Do you know I was blocked from my page and could not see my plan The only thing I was able to do was pay the rate increase for the month The next morning I called State Farm WOW I such a GREAT rate and coverage I wish I changed sooner Not only did I save close to a month I also received full coverage on all roadside service and increases my bodily injury and pip rates for a month for me and my husband It has been everything happens for a reason YES Thankfully for us screw up was my Blessing needs to train their Service representatives better and know what your company policy is and define it clearly The company also needs to notify their customers prior to their changes in writing and when they take effect common business practices Now I wait for my refund which says that lies and does not follow through on what they say Still waiting on refund  
 I received a six month renewal which had me paying almost twelve dollars extra each month from the previous contract I called and asked for an explanation because I felt that my is now older it has now been six months longer since a chargeable accident it is now six months longer since a moving violation AND I asked for a veteran's discount Firstly I was the rates in my neighborhood have risen since the amount of claims have risen poor poor SECOND I have not been receiving a veteran discount because I am not retired SO WHAT Even Verizon recognizes my four years of service in the Vietnam war era YET raised my rates eleven dollars I called USAA and received the same coverage PLUS twenty percent above the actual value costing five dollars AND STILL my cost was twenty dollars less than To top this off I had paid early and when they returned my money they charged me for their service to do so Hahaha I guess I am a fool  
 added MBI on brand new Toyota Shame on you Warren Buffet Did you not learn your lesson from fake accounts with Wells Fargo I was on the phone with for both policies being transferred and Mechanical Breakdown was never discussed I hope someday we a class action suit and sue I bitched and demanded a refund which they did finally give me Always check your policy with 
 In I was in a head on collision that was the other fault A very serious accident His paid me the maximum of his policy which did not even cover of my medical expenses I paid extra for under insured motorists coverage The claims agent refused to pay the market value for my and me that if I accept their offer they would tow the totaled to my home and charge me for towing and storage I was forced to settle for approximately less than its value Then claims agent me not to an attorney because I would the maximum claim amount of because it was such a bad accident After a year of excuses they me they were paying me nothing for a heart injury and neck injury with medical bills exceeding At this point it was difficult an attorney because I waited a year believing lies It has been years and every time I think they are to make a settlement offer they ask for ridiculous amounts of paperwork from me like years worth of tax returns from my business I have never negotiated with such a corrupt company Do not ever consider having  
 A woman ran a red light almost hit her and I did I had two witnesses who called The woman she   just quite make it through the light   The witnesses say she did not even look up The adjuster I should have waited for her Huh What rule book is she reading from anyway Very bad Co to do business with Scammers and Thieves Tell all your friends to drop them  
 Two weeks ago we had a super high tide at the same time as a super moon My stuck in a flood There was water up to the door line My stalled It took the Adjuster Justin ** days to to me Then it appeared he believed he work with the shop not me the customer That being he does not listen to what the shop says either regarding work they need do to repair a completely In addition though he returns to the shop he never looks at the work being done Cynthia ** his supervisor seems to be a bit better than Justin Had she been the adjuster my would have had better care with more input from me She also communicates where Justin thinks he and the shop do whatever they like with no input from me He seems to override any choice Cynthia makes Bryon ** Cynthia's boss never returns a call from a customer I left messages He called back a week later in time to be too late to do anything or have any input Between the of them all they wanted was to be done with the claim In every case when I had an issue they   this is the shop you chose    From the beginning of this claim was horrible In a busy Metropolitan Area did not have a shop to do the repairs It took days to out to inspect My stalled in Salt Water during a flash flood Instead of totaling it which would have been done they attempted to fix it new engine new starter various other items and issues amounting to over dollars in work I am sure there be other issues but to the Service I not be keeping the long enough I have had for more than years In NY I never had any issue with them Everything was always done perfectly The Florida Team is awful and has no understanding of customer service nor do they believe believe the person paying for the is their customer I now likely have a total loss on the Tell me why do I have  
  raised my rates % and NEVER filed a claim in yrs trying to tell me that the data from the DOT and NHTSA show that Duluth GA has more accidents and a higher cost of living than Buckhead Atlanta GA When I asked if required or willing to share the data that using to justify that rate increase that occurred because I moved from Atlanta GA to Duluth GA they they required and share that information It looks like there was also a requirement by congress for NHTSA to update how they sample in and curious if there is something wrong with their software  
 We have been customers for years Recently we had a tree fall on our van We took advantage of   Auto Repair XPress   advertised service Closest 'center' was Key Collision in Salem NH Long story short they repaired the tree damage however they damaged the in the shop scratching both doors and staining the interior first with oil then with water damage did not as promised   conduct a pre delivery review of your before you are notified that it is ready to be returned to you    nor did they provide   Satisfaction with a timely repair that is backed by a written lifetime guarantee that be provided when you take delivery of your repaired    Instead I went to pick up the and there was no rep there and I was the to point out that the was damaged It took week until the was 'ready' and when I went to pick it up again saw that not all the damage had been fixed and there was water damage to the interior now as well The adjuster apologized and he'd escalate to his supervisor That was a week ago I have STILL not heard from and called the adjuster again BEWARE I would NEVER again go to a 'Xpress Repair' center And after this experience I am to be shopping for new This ordeal has been on now for over a month and my is worse off now than it was before totally ridiculous Oh and was happy to take my deductible although the was actually damaged during the repair  
 I put a quote in the system for my van individuals I talked to asked for updated information and I gave it to them however when I received the quote the information had not been changed So then I proceed to speak to a th person who is a supervisor because I have time to repeat myself She proceeds to tell me that my is a commercial I stated that I no longer use this for commercial work that I work for WC Smith full time I her that I did not state that his was commercial but she proceeded to actually call me a liar I called company and was due to the make of my truck that it is deemed a commercial I think this is a bunch of bull but at least I understand now assume that I know the rules and regulations of this type truck but also call me the customer a liar Allstate sucks but you are worse Next time assume  
 I was recently involved in an accident where I was tail ended by a customer I believe he was texting when he hit me from behind and pushed me into the in front of me Both of us were stopped The posted speed limit was MPH I found to be very nonresponsive and difficult to deal with on my repairs They were slow to react and argued about the diminished value and repairs to my They refused to pay for an alignment offered a fraction of the lost value of my and left me with over in expenses not to mention my time investment and frustration I strongly recommend to my friends and family not to trust with my property based on my experience I am being forced to file suit against the insured for damages in an attempt to be made whole I would be furious if my insurer allowed me to be sued it should not be this difficult  
 September I was hit by an insured driver of The driver indicated she was leaving the gas pump when she hit the front right side of my bending the wheel to the point I had to call a tow truck As we began exchanging information I noticed she did not have her DL or proof of but handed me a piece of paper with a name # and Progressive as the provider When I asked for her DL # she she know it and me I could contact Progressive provide them with her license plate information to file the claim Feeling uncertain about the situation I contacted the police By the time they arrived so had left the scene The police officer evaluated the accident ran her tags and me the was insured with The driver had provided me with a false name phone number and company The officer completed the incident report and classified it as a hit and run Once I was able to find out the true identity of the driver I contacted to file a claim To date I have provided them with a recorded statement the handwritten note from the driver the pictures of the damages to both my and body along with the police report stating it was a hit and run On Oct denied my claim stating insufficient documentation to support my damages After speaking to them regarding the matter they me I would need to provide them with a copy of the video proving their driver hit me I am beyond frustrated because at first they me if the officer reported as a hit and run they would repair my Now they are requesting the video in an attempt not to pay  
I have had auto for yrs I recently moved from San Diego to Las Vegas where less traffic and I barely drive I expected my policy to cost less and instead it more than doubled From a month to Now I care about accident rates etc This amount is completely insane and they should be ashamed of themselves for trying to charge consumers this amount curious what their CEOs make I advised them that I would be transferring ALL my Allstate only charged me for same coverage = Greedy B fill in the blank 
 The customer service department over the phone is times better than with an actual representative If you pay your premiums they are elated but if you have a claim they make you feel like a CRIMINAL They are rude uninformed under trained from the regional managers to the small claims adjuster They train their adjusters to DENY any claim that you have The call service representatives do NOT thoroughly explain coverage or options The only good experience is roadside assistance and your rental coverage They are scammers when it comes to policy as well as they racially profile when it comes to adjusting your They fight you tooth and nail over things policy should carry ALWAYS report incidents with police because they tell you unnecessary then DENY your claim I have had them for years and ANY time I needed something done with my it was either denied due to the way my plan was set up or blatantly DISMISSED back to a individualized agent where the quality is more driven towards customer service because fails in that department I also feel like been ripped off and treated as DIRT ONLY use them for a short period of time if you have to Send all messages to corporate in writing because the District and Regional Managers could care less Done with giving my money to companies who could care less about me as a consumer  
 My husband and I have had auto for almost a year through their military department Yesterday morning we awoke to a loud crash from outside our house Someone had run into our company truck pushing it into our front yard After exchanging information with the person we pulled the footage of the accident from our security cameras The person that hit our truck was backwards at a very fast speed apparently trying to run over a bicyclist he was having an altercation with I filed my claim with shortly after the accident and called my assigned claims agent this morning explaining how the accident took place My agent refused to send someone out to asses the accident He spoke down to me and called my husband a decorated Marine   trash   When we asked him to speak to his supervisor he     only tell you her name   I am so upset with this lousy company  
 I purchased my policy with in June After speaking with the sales rep and advising that I needed full coverage because I had a lien holder the sales rep gave me a quote that I thought was overpriced so I advised him that I was to keep looking He then asked me to hold to see if there were any other discounts he could apply When he returned he gave me a quote that I better agreed with and me he was providing me with everything that the state of SC required So I thought I was good to go until hurricane Matthew came through my became flooded due to all the rain and flooding in my neighborhood When I called to do my claim I was that I only had liability and if I added full coverage right then at a price of dollars for the remaining payment I would have a better chance of having my claim accepted so I did and they still denied my claim They admitted to me that they had my lien holders listed and sure why only liability was only added by the sales rep but that there was nothing they could do I owe on my I have had to pay a tow company to tow my to the mechanics rent a to back and forth to work and school and now sure my is a total loss and I be able to pay my lien holder so they repo it and add it to my credit report  
  only take your money but never help you when you submit a claim A horrible company and no wonder they are so cheap You what you paid for After five years of no accidents I decided to leave them after I submitted a claim for hitting a small object on the freeway  
 I had been with for years and found out that they were overcharging my premiums I switched companies on September and to date they have not refunded my premiums of This after I had to stay on their case to them to refund a overpayment on my premiums  
In my brother had with and put me on as a driver He cancer and was bedfast and after he passed away they took the last payment thru his account I had to close his bank account and now I called them and they I had to pay my brother’s account before they put me on so I hung up He called me back and it was taken care of but thought about and canceled but it went thru my bank account and they want refund until last of the month What a company Don’t anyone to go thru when you lose a family member 
I called to a quote to see how much it would be to add a driver to our policy The person have their license yet and I was weighing out whether they should their own policy or we do the family without warning added her to the policy and basically raised our premium when it was an inquiry I did not want her added to the policy at least not at that moment I am leaving and never looking back They are very scandalous and frustrating to do business with 
 I called to my information so I could my stickers for my they informed me that they cancelled my because they verify my spouse's information Well a Widow so upset right now They draft my checking account every month to their money but they have the decency to inform me my was cancelled Hate never again I insure with this horrible company Bad Bad  
 I paid my But when someone hits me on the highway they act like I have I had to go to the doctor for my injuries and they want to pay for it even though I had medical coverage added I had to call my lawyer to them to pay the doctors never tell anyone to with They are horrible  
 I reject and denounce all business with for they are a non Christ believing company They no longer now or in future be my carrier I off phone interview with customer service call center rep and he employees are required to work ALL major Holidays I but Christmas is a Holy Day He NO EXCEPTIONS And then he asked if I wanted to withdraw my application and end the interview Wow A company who does not honor religious holidays is bad business in my opinion and possibly corrupt in nature in other areas as well saying  
 What the hell happened to the personalized agent you know the who takes care of your claim when you have an issue It takes two days to receive an email the current procedure Unacceptable I pay every month for a service in case an accident were to occur I have had for over twenty something years dealing with a call center and back and forth voice mails Half ass instructions on what website I need to access to receive reimbursements supposed to navigate registration after reading a mile long required reading in order to sign up to receive to bank America I read register and then find out my agent hadn't processed crap on their end and wasted hour on top of the four months time waiting ** already served for my loyalty as a customer I call ** Very disappointed Do not process requests like simple address changes made over the phone to a live person four times in the past four months Waiting three months for a reimbursement check received from the at fault company on my behalf four months ago I received crap I am so disappointed in  
 I have been insured with for over years I recently bought a new so made changes to my declarations policy When I receive my new policy I found things I did not authorize nor want The agent took it upon themselves to add Mechanical Breakdown for a brand new at every six months Wait not all they also added roadside assistance and rental reimbursement I the agent multiple times I did not want nor need these coverages I had never even heard of Mechanical Breakdown so how was it I was paying for it I reviewed my policy and found all these coverages I did not want but was paying an extra a year for When I called to inquire and repeat I did not want nor need these coverages I was   Well they are only so many dollars a month    Not only did I pay for coverages I did not want but paid for I knew nothing about Why would anyone want Mechanical Breakdown when you have a new warranty and extended warranty Buyer beware check your coverages seems to add things to your policy you tell them you do not want nor need of course at your expense After all this they refund the overcharges of and not charge me for the days of unauthorized coverages How nice of them Nice try  
 A person having ran into my all their fault I have company would not pay for G M parts my being a G M product adjuster cut a check after looking at the did not even allow me to any estimates on my own Of course when I went to the body shop of my choice picked randomly closest to my home They could not do the work for the amount that the adjuster gave The body shop only use G M parts cannot guarantee his work otherwise So my only legal recourse is to pay the difference then sue the person that hit my in small claims court So what I want to say to people who think they are saving money with you pay way or if you damage person's pay you will spends a lot of money on cute lizard ads but they care about you is all about maximizing their profit at the expense of all us owners no matter what side of the claim on Forget about ethics in business forget about doing the right thing making money is the only important thing I hope people consumers see that doing business like this is wrong You conduct business with integrity you conduct business in which no is damaged and everyone is satisfied It is possible maybe you should read some John Maxwell books You know the New York times bestseller Read about ethics in business Ever heard of the golden rule  
 I received an online quote for automobile via The quoted premium was quite a bargain relative to what I am currently paying I was definitely compelled to make the switch Two days later I received a phone call from a local rep I explained my reason for wanting to make a switch and he he could my new policy started as soon as I make the first month's premium payment I him I wanted to first notify my current carrier with an effective termination date of my current policy to be four days later I explained I wanted my policy activation date to begin the same day my coverage ends with my current company He me that as long as I make the first month's premium payment made by pm the day before the effective cancellation date the policy would begin in a seamless fashion So I called the rep the day before my termination of my current policy and the call began with him eagerly taking my credit card information Thought we were about finished but he then goes into a   song and dance   that he needed to check the information of my listed drivers before finalizing the activation Well he   plugged   in the driver's info and began acting like he was utterly shocked by my auto related history which he came from notes made by my current company who I have been with for years He went on to say that there was no way he could maintain the original quote that the revised quote be much higher I him this whole situation was completely out of line due to the fact that he knew I was canceling my current based on the quote being so much better and because he never he would have to re check my info which could result in a much higher premium cost What's on in my head So he knows over the barrel to be without auto the next day and figures go along with this nonsense Nope I called my current carrier and them to un cancel me NOTE All this information had already been submitted for the online quote Additionally I have a nearly flawless driving record in all the time I have been with my current carrier I should have gone with my gut with this deal from the start A quote that seemed too good to be true An rep who speaks like he could float between other jobs such as used sales loan shark pool hustler carny worker snake oil peddler etc etc  
 I was in a collision which totaled my Ford Explorer The person who hit me was covered by Trying to settle the claim was a truly terrible experience I was personally insulted by the adjuster Claudine ** She questioned my integrity and she insulted my intelligence with her counter offers and unhelpfulness Her supervisors were no more helpful Her conduct specifically drove me to retain an attorney after nearly a year and a half of trying to deal with it myself I asking for an outrageous sum of money I was able to receive what I requested once I retained an attorney Had Ms ** been remotely reasonable and not so personally offensive I would have settled for considerably less She cost her company money as a direct result of her unprofessional and insulting conduct When interviewing attorneys they laughed and sighed when I mentioned who the adjuster was on the case Her reputation for being difficult is apparently well known in this area Perhaps it serves well in the short term to have adjusters behave this way but the long term cost is that I never consider for any needs Furthermore I would discourage anyone from using and encourage any current customers to switch Maybe it seems ok to have horrible behavior working on your behalf but consider that if this is the company ethos then how they treat you when you are making a claim Caveat emptor with FTR I have never made a claim like this before I understand companies need to fight off fraudulent claims and minimize claim amounts but there is no excuse to treat claimants poorly And I am a busy professional I do not have the time to waste the runaround by an company so they save a few pennies Lesson learned I retain an attorney immediately if this ever happens to me again So I have to thank for my capitulating to the perpetuation of the personal injury lawyer racket Thanks for that too  
 I have been using for more than year It was all fine as I was paying them on time and I never had to claim Today on I had claim first time They recommend me in Uptown Collision Houston The auto repair shop did fix the problem in but they broke my key They tapped the key so I notice the time I was leaving the shop but key broke same day in few hours when I tried to turn off the ignition It was horrible experience as both and repair shop step aside and I had to bear all cost + the issues having key stuck in the ignition I definitely raise a police complaint regarding this behavior as it caused me time and lots of effort regardless of the result company pays lots of money in advertisement but they put for their customer As it is mandate to have an by state then state duty to regulate company For me meaning you have peace of mind which definitely seem happening with I would not recommend having and specially Uptown Collision in Houston I try to give feedback to every single forum possible  
In time of need not be there Been with them for over years After I came back from my trip needed roadside assistance They claim an existing problem that I need to pay for it in cash because my was sitting in place for over months since they advised me to temporary cancel my roadside service and have it back once I return Even after I pay for the service they refuse to help and AAA WAS RIGHT THERE TO ASSIST ME So people once you are a customer does not offer you the service you deserve and pay for I wish I could give them half of a star 
 I am appalled at how my claim was handled at I hit something on the freeway and popped tires and punctured my wheel on Not thinking would cover tires I purchased new tires When I learned of the punctured Wheel I called They agreed to cover everything and sent an adjuster to the tire shop There he took pictures documented everything and gave me a check payable to myself and BMW Financial not the shop So I was out of pocket for the tires I then took the to BMW dealer to the new wheel and alignment The dealer do anything with that check had given me and I was have to mail it to BMW Financial in state and have it signed over by BMW Financial but I also needed to send in all my receipts I receipts until I paid for the repairs which were After spending over hours trying to this sorted out finally agreed to pay the shop direct duh I thought everything was fine until it came time for me to pick up my The adjuster texts me and says   sorry my printer working and I print any checks to pay for your OR reimburse you   Umm what thing about this adjuster is his phone working the entire time so we had to rely on text messages I felt like I was working some backyard sketchy deal or something So had to come up with over out of pocket to my been the most frustrating horrible experience ever The lack of customer care is not worth it You pay for expecting you'll be taken care of when you need it That is not what happened to me at and still without a dime for reimbursement Why do I even have I certainly let everyone know what a complete fluster this experience has been and if you pay be prepared to lose your money because when it comes time and you need NOT back your claim  
 They offered me a good auto policy for my on the phone I had email contact with of the agents and provided her with all the necessary information When I did not hear from her back I called them up and all of a sudden a different agent me that they were not able to provide me with an So I went from a good deal on a policy to no at all Ridiculous  
 The adjuster me it was too far for them to come & inspect my damage She was more than happy to total it out or I was to have it towed to them in St Louis I important enough Then speaking with her supervisor even though adjusters in Indiana were closer they refused coming to look at my LOUSY SERVICE NO SERVICE Lisa ** adjuster Jarrod ** supervising adjuster manager I was if when they total my I could buy it back My only has miles on it It is paid for Still they insist that how things are to happen pissed DO NOT EVER USE  
I have had the worst experience with Auto claims I was involved in an accident with two insured drivers at the same time agreed that their drivers were at fault and both received traffic citations But when it came to paying out the claim I had to chase down different claim adjusters who both work at who both blamed for the reason the claim check hadn't been issued I had to make endless phone calls and emails to a result I am so glad I have Progressive Because company is the worst when trying to them pay out a claim which was their insurer's fault 
 I had an accident with driver I changed lanes and the driver let me change so he hit my fender so declined coverage citing they could not determine who was at fault I was with for over years and incident happened I hit an animal damaged my front bumper so me that we have animals and they did not believe me lol so if we have animals then why sells comprehensive to cover animal damages So again they declined the coverage and the claim It is true is cheap but they fight every claim to make you cancel it and they delay it and send an examiner and then make recording statements with several agents and require you to come in person and meet with them to waste your time and then if you come they cancel the claim citing you did not cooperate lol Run from them I have AAA now and so happy they kept their promise and they never made me pay higher rate for using my policy  
 Monday around pm while gas I notice damage to my in the passenger side Is only been to work and Walgreens assuming my was hit on the passenger's side while I was inside a store Once I notice the damage I contacted right away to make a claim stating my had been damaged and was very upset emotionally Because this is a brand new the claims department was very nice and comforting assuring me it be a problem and set up the earliest appointment at an auto shop for my to be dropped off hassle free I was greeted by an adjuster who came out to inspect my and immediately stated the damage looked as if I hit something Uhm I hadn't hit anything but someone obviously hit me Long story short being given the whole   We need to have an expert come out to diagnose the damage and see if you were actually hit ” Wait What I was completely confused I was the victim of an obvious hit and run Now being treated as if I was at fault And now the so call simple claim has turned into approx week ordeal because being accused of not being truthful about my being damaged To add salt to my wound the adjuster handed me a appraisal so I would know what I might have to pay if my claim accepted This is beyond stressful and truly disappointing I have insured with this company for over yrs and this is how you are treated for a claim not to jump to conclusions but when treating your customers who keep your company in business like crap is never a good thing Social media has been the death and end to numerous businesses as well as jobs If my claim is not accepted I plan to fight this and spread the word via social media etc of the unfair practices of Shame on you for treating customers like criminals  
 I called to reinstate my Policy with and I must have chosen the wrong group of staff to talk with The Agent refused to give his name and the Supervisor refused to give her last name and maybe her name Jordan is not real I have been with for more than years and they have been losing their touch Do not listen to the commercials I am very dissatisfied with after all of these years The Supervisor who voiced her number as ** was not helpful at all She was more interested in siding with her staff than trying to maintain a customer who had been with them for more than years Very Disappointed  
 So where do I even begin Let's first start with the fact that I filled a claim after I discovered my was hit in the parking lot while I was at work I have phone records that I called and my family after the incident happened and pictures of the damage which I uploaded to the claim on website I tried to in touch with my claims adjuster for over weeks after I opened the claim but I never received a call back after over messages left and complaints to the website online complaint center I was finally contacted by a new adjuster who like it was a normal thing   oh sorry the last person assigned to you was promoted so she neglected all of her clients for weeks    What kind of business is this that a managers even realize or care that their employees are not answering or responding to their clients This was the first headache of many that I had with this claim I should have taken it as a sign and symbol of how treats their customers and switched insurers right then and there but unfortunately you do that Anyway the next steps were for me to go through a recorded statement over the phone with an adjuster which I did After that I dropped off my for an inspection and to repaired the damage significant and only showed k in damage The body adjuster at the repair shop gave me a rental which he stated would be % covered based on my I great and left for work only to a call on the way from the other adjuster who works in an office and who I never I recorded my statement with that I was being investigated and the repairs and rental were not yet approved so I would have to pay for the rental out of pocket Then she proceeds to tell me that having the rental without claim approval was actually illegal on my part and I was breaking the law even though the body adjuster at the shop gave it to me I was outraged especially because I even need the rental since I lived so close to work and I even asked the body adjuster numerous times if it was covered and I was assured it was by him It then became apparent that the adjusters for do not communicate with each other nor do they care about their customers I tried to return the the next day a Friday at the repair shop and after being assured my would be ready to swap for the rental I had however when I arrived I was by the receptionist that my bumper was off of my and I would have to wait three days to swap because nobody worked on the weekend At this point I was very angry and upset that I was lied to twice by the auto body adjuster at the repair shop st that the rental was covered and approved nd that my was ready in the front of the shop to swap for the rental So much of my time money and energy have been wasted by this point that I was ready to cancel my and pay for everything out of pocket since it would be less of a nightmare When Monday comes I make arrangements to leave work early to meet with a investigator to again explain my claim and try to return the rental My anger has subsided after the weekend passed but quickly came back once the office adjuster assigned to me called to let me know that the body adjuster filled two more claims on my for tiny dents and they wanted statements on those as well This is illegal for to do without my permission by the way but they filled them anyway The problem with these claims is that they show up on my driving record forever and if I try to switch insurers which I am planning to do the new insurer see these and keep my rates higher as a result I then demand to speak with my claims adjusters boss which I am transferred to but does not answer his phone I leave a message with a laundry list of complaints but never a call back a week has gone by now I beyond annoyed and distraught over the service I have received at and I even comprehend as a business woman how this company is still in service with people so incompetent working for them  
When I called to inquire about rates for my daughter's new I was that the rates here in the rural Atlanta area were the highest in the country rep was from Macon and very aware of rates in this state Since she was moving to California I needed quotes for the LA area The rep me that they would be the lowest in the country When I asked why so high in rural Georgia she me because there are so many deer accidents that total I actually questioned her at length regarding this versus hitting other with drivers that could be injured She assured that she was accurate Well when my daughter spoke with a rep from CA she was that the rates would be more than twice what she was quoted in GA This rep could only apologize and that we were mis informed She also me that she was not able to identify who I spoke with last even when she had the exact dates for changes I am sure the companies keep track of this information I was very surprised by the difference in rep information We have been loyal customers for over years I be looking for company that be honest with their customers 
I asked for an additional driver billing details Customer executive me the billing info But I was not interested to add him at the same time She me to complete some process of signing to remove him I never asked to add him I want the info which could have been a query check They want to make business in this way Not really recommended Finally I sent the necessary documents signing in at pm of my time on the same day She everything is fine but finally the amount displayed in my next month billing I know what to say here No notification to me but charged If I ask now they me to pay the amount They would send me a mail which would be days and I should sign it and send back Again cheap business ever request for information it cost you not recommended for its poor customer care 
An insured by ran into the back of my over a week now and they refuse to accept liability of damage stating I MUST GO THROUGH MY COMPANY and my company says their fault and if I go through my company I have to pay deductible and pay for police report This is a horrible company and this should not happen Please assist 
I was in parking lot waiting for a parking space when a insured driven by a young lady backed into the side of my She had a bike on a rear bike rack that hit the sight side of my She caused a inch bend in the side and a cracked side window I contacted and was we were both percent responsible because I did not sound my horn to warn her of the pending collision It seem this is how and other insurers are avoiding repairs 
 Took our truck being in the shop months before we were called and it would be weeks due to a part shortage on a Ford F Then was it could actually be an additional weeks if there enough new parts released So six months in the shop basically covered a rental for only and the simpering fake voice of the supervisor who called assured me that she   understood and felt our pain   but unfortunately her hands were tied So covers of a rental for the time needed regardless of circumstances  
 According to you and your last email even though you improperly falsely communicated the cost billing amounts over instead of the that I was quoted when I inquired and changed my billing for my and motor home You are when no money is currently owed without renewing my current policy you are trying to hold me hostage to pay you a ransom in an amount that   must   be paid before any changes are made and in fact is not due until am Therefore it becomes obvious that you have no intention to keep a valued customer over years without paying you off as some form of tribute first If that is the case Then have a nice day and your behavior be noted in customer reviews  
 Going through had a pickup truck reserved three different occasions There were no trucks available Went through different locations No trucks available each time was downgraded to a small SUV or a when specifically reserved a pickup truck Also through they tend to use up your allowed allowances for the rental all it takes is to be honest and paid jobs  
 I urge that you obtain coverage from a company that treats their customers with respect My year old daughter recently her restricted license and as a customer we began receiving notices from requesting we add her to a policy for coverage or provide proof that she is covered by an plan She own a and exact driving but I began shopping around to see what it'd cost me When I logged into my account and used the quote option they automatically took it upon themselves to add her to my policy and increased my monthly bill by I called to question why she was automatically added when I was only looking to obtain a quote under their   quote   option online I requested they remove her and they refused to unless I provided them with proof that my daughter who have a and has a restricted license has coverage I never attempted to add her I cancelled my coverage and went with State Farm I was furious Upon cancelling the agent went on to tell me that I had a balance of on my account from the date I a quote to the date I cancelled my plan because they had covered my daughter Again I Never asked to add my daughter to my policy this all resulted from me looking to a quote shady and have no respect for their customers I had been a customer for over years DO NOT TRUST  
 My wife had an accident where this entered the carpool lane illegally because there was only person in the and rear ended her causing my wife a mild concussion and lost of days of works The Crooks came to my house to take pictures of the accident and were forcing my wife to take a check for for all damages When my wife refused they turned very violent toward her and few days later they denied liability to pay all my wife medical bills stating that the bumper of the absorbed all the damages and all of the sudden they are doctors because they think my wife did not incur in any injury even though she has present them with different reports that otherwise If you have please I urge you to cancel it immediately because maybe you save some money monthly but when it comes to an accident they are the biggest and most dishonest criminals in the market  
 A few weeks ago I was involved in a mini accident A insurer ran an all way stop sign and hit me in the rear of my passenger side and my back wheel tire Driver admitted to me he did not stop and kept apologizing His passenger kept asking if I was ok Anyways to make a long story short the driver insisted that I did not call the cops and he insisted in paying me off He called me so many times after the incident after we agreed to meet at an auto body shop later in the day On my way to the shop driver me he was unable to come and to let him know the cost I contacted him after the shop estimated my damages When I him over he then started to accuse me of running the stop sign I contacted his right after explained to them what happened and off the bat before even seeing my the representative stated all they pay me is % since my word vs his Common how I run the stop sign if my was hit in the back Anyways after that I contacted my they came to inspect my and they sent me my estimates right away It was over as the shop called me back a week and a half after stating they pay me % again not even seeing my damages The inspector came yesterday gave me an estimate of and change To my curiosity I kept asking how it be less that the estimate than the shop and my The inspector what he sees is such an unfair company No wonder wack ** drivers take this it matches the driver It is on three weeks now I have not received payment and I am unable to use my If I sue this company I will  
 Worst Do Not unless you never plan to have someone hit you About months ago I change my and motorcycle to and saved about weeks ago a truck hit my van with a full police report showing the truck driver is at fault the police report me they need it it would take them weeks to it I had to go it from State police and pay After I uploaded it nobody reviewed it called them times and every time I call its a new person and nobody knows anything about the case They are giving me less than what the van is worth saying the van is totaled holding me accountable for the deductible and not the other party saying I might my deductible back All they care about is towing the van out of the auto body show to total the van and sell it at auction to their money first before they pay me Nobody has called me but the person that looked at the van he want to tow the van so they have to pay storage fees and force me to agree to their value Nobody has called me for weeks The website app you submit your stuff to I submitted my towing bill pictures hotel cost medical bill the next day I think any body even looks at it Every time you call its a new person that answers the phone and asks you the same questions over and over again its back to step Every person you talk to is polite but its all scripted like a robot what you is the silent treatment and a app and website been driving since been and now is the Worst company had to deal with already insured my used new van back with Farmers Saving a year not worth losing hours of your day dealing with stuff should be doing for you and paying you less than market value for your holding you accountable for deductible when you are not at fault not calling you back having nobody that knows your case If you need help after hours or the weekend you a person that says they only type things into the computer Call back on business hours When they say you what you pay for well is like the menu at MacD but you have to pull it out of the ground wash it cut it cook it wait give % of it back to them You are better off paying a bit more let the little green lizard sell you is HORRIBLE  
 We were with OVER years and never had a major claim of our fault Then we had a bad accident that caused over damage and injuries They refused to support us at court case when we had three witness that the other driver was speeding and ran a red light Then after they lost k they increased our cost by percent Had they support us in court and requested the camera at the intersection they would have found the other person percent at fault After years with the company they treated us like ** and only gave us two thirds of what our new was worth They talk like good but when you have an problem they support you  
 I called to ask to move my due date back days After my husband recently lost his job paying our with the same paycheck I pay the mortgage was causing us to be low on funds for that pay period I called to request that they allow me to move my due date to make things a little more manageable even before he lost his job we were stretched thin by having them on the same pay period The CS agent informed me that doing so would result in my policy increasing by a month every month I in no way see how the same coverage would cost me more to pay days later each month He then encouraged me to leave it as is and pay it late every month and that I would letters each month telling me they would cancel it if I pay by a certain date but be penalized for paying late Increasing premiums because my policy's due date would be days later is not justifiable and telling me to pay late every month and threats of policy termination is unconscionable  
 I switched my auto from Liberty to over the phone and the broker who I spoke with and signed up with lied First he me if I had as my primary for medical instead of my health provider for some crazy reason the auto is cheaper This made no sense but he swore to it and me I would save X My mistake I believed him After I signed up a bill came in I called and broker who me the initial broker   was mistaken   and why there is a bill He changed the policy to what I requested and the bill became a credit my first screwing Secondly the initial broker me no reason for me to contact Liberty They be notified on the day my policy starts and the Liberty end My second error I did not call Liberty because I believed the liar A few days later Liberty takes out payment from my checking account and I screw up and call assuming that things crossed because my life was crazy at that point Then I forgot about it until I saw Liberty took out the second month's payment I called and I am   sorry for the inconvenience   and they ask me for the phone number to Liberty So now I am out I have double for two months and while the customer service person is on the phone to speak with Liberty I must stay on the phone So care about my time or my money The agent should be FIRED and lose his license  
 I switched to months ago and this weekend I had an accident while I was out of town in the middle of a large snow storm in North California in Lake Tahoe I have had the absolute worst experience with they help you I have spent on average hours over the phone talking to them within a day period I had to do all the legwork setting up everything during and after the accident Even though they charge monthly for   emergency roadside assistance    service they made me call all the tow truck companies in the area in the middle of a snow storm with the energy & wifi off and on because of the storm trust me it was a hell of an experience for Hours it took me approximately hours to the tow truck which I had to do it all by myself All does is sit back and wait for you to call expecting you to be an expert in these situations and expecting you to have all the tow truck companies' information Also every ** time I would call I would a new person and that person would ask me the same ** questions which I had to explain every single time what was on because there is not organization no accountability and they give a ** about you DO NOT USE They expect you to do it all If you want something from them like a tow truck you better pay out of pocket do it all yourself and then request a reimbursement there goes more wasted time effort Every time you call it is an hour ordeal and at the end of the call we tend to progress It is the same thing with every person I speak to This is so frustrating I hope I could take this issue to a corporate manager or someone that would be interested in making this corporation better for the customer if they care Again DO NOT USE had several companies in the past and never had close to such experience  
 So here is my horror story Keep in mind had the same crappy plow truck for years with the same full coverage in case it breaks down and also to cover the plow since it costs a pretty penny to have my plowing done by someone else if my plow was broken in an accident etc Well months ago I had a vandalism Someone broke into my truck in November stole the battery cut wires under the hood and dash stole the starter the wiring for the plow the plow controller and a myriad of other things I have security cameras and the agent in all her wisdom Cheryl of Minnesota decided it was likely a fraud case ON A TRUCK WORTH MAYBE AT BEST Anyways they investigated me for over months During that time it snowed several times costing me in plowing expenses Finally their fraud investigator calls me and specifically says   Is there anything else you want to tell me The truth come out you know    I   well my truck was vandalized and you guys your stuff together   Luckily the neighbors a Kindercare next door had their buses parked feet from my plow and also had all their mirrors stolen off their buses the same day They called to verify that fact months later and were able to determine that I trying to commit fraud Now skip ahead month I end up having to buy a new truck to prepped to put a plow on it thinking no way to fix it and if so it be before winter is over at this rate Well they decided that this rusty plow truck with literal holes through the cab to the outside is worth to fix So they tell Friendly Chevrolet to fix the damn thing They fix it and because it had been sitting so long the fuel pump now no longer works and the guy at the dealership says they fix it as it was unrelated to the vandalism So now out the cost of that They also paid the dealership for the repairs yet going on weeks now and they also are refusing to cover my plow which I had taken an extra policy out on since it was the only thing worth money on that truck Now the kicker on the plow theft is They cover it because at the time of theft it on the truck Fair enough right Well the thing of it is it was on the truck when the vandals took it off to try steal it The tow truck that sent to pick up the truck from my parking lot take the plow with like he was supposed to and left it sitting right in front of where the truck was Well due to that error the thieves then stole the plow that day or later that night I know I there But it apparently was my responsibility to secure an lb snow plow with no truck to move it since they towed my only way of moving it How the EFF was I supposed to do that I still have a running truck I still have any compensation for the plow nor do I have any hope of this being resolved anytime soon Absolute nightmare of a company Sounds great on the ads but if you ever need to use the beware They fight you every step of the way and try and weasel out of paying on any claim using scare tactics threats you name it I never ever use this company again and I continue to share my horrible experience with anyone and everyone AGH  
 If I had an opportunity to meet Jesus or before Id choose Jesus Strike Two and Three doesnt care about you My ex husband have had for over years and suggested I tried this company so I switch company In Feb of last year I was rear ended while on highway driving in Atlanta GA On March a couple of weeks later I was rear ended for the second time at a stop light on Lawrence highway in Atlanta GA waiting for it to turn green The person who hit my took off like a bat out of hell and left me there crying and in extreme pain due to the fact I was in an accident in Feb contacted in tears and in pain while waiting for the police to come to my location I was in shocked that someone would hit my and leave me there However representative was so rude and made assumption that I was responsible for both accident even disclaiming my injuries and treatment even though they received two separate police report and hospital bills Both persons that hit me were % at fault Fast forward to their investigation and five different people coming out to my home my job and all came up with the same conclusion I was not at fault That did not sit well with who hired their own attorney a BULLY Female who tried to trick me up but couldnt because the truth always prevail This attorney put me through hell even after telling her I needed to back home to take care of my mom who was ill with cancer and in her final stage of death She so personally as to ask me why was I still seeing my ex husband as to how I cared for my dying mother and why was I not working I thought her next question was what color underwear I had on To make matter worst the engine died in my and after opening my mail I saw there had increase my premiums sky rocket up a Customer service dont give a dory kind word if I took my business cross the street This increase and the abuse by reps and attorney is a great example of how much you pay for and when you have or two incident that is completely NOT YOUR FAULT they chastised you and increase your rate Had I been ** No issues  
 Incompetence at its finest My wife and I purchased through back in January We did save money initially but the problems soon followed Not a month after we started policies my wife fiancée at the time and I both received letters from the Arizona Department of Transportation saying that our registrations would be revoked because we had no proof of for our a matter insisted they handled I called more times and never resolved the issue My wife had to take a day off work to take proof of into the DMV herself Strike One After we married in September we called to renew our policies We were that if we combined our policies as a married couple we would save some money My surprise when the quote sent to my email was different than the quoted over the phone We save money by combining our policy went up dollars and the coverages driving histories were exactly the same as months prior Strike Two I received a renewal notice about a month ago nothing has changed but somehow my policy increased by dollars Strike Three I have wised up and moved onto American Family now but their last laugh in today I received a letter from the lien holder on my jeep saying that because I did not have from September to January my payment for those months was increased by dollars so that they could cover basic for their right when my wife and I combined policies it increased bucks and never reported my new policy number to my lien holder Now I have to square myself with the lien holder who might potentially report my   late payments   as I was unaware of the additional cost until today to the credit bureaus and ruin an credit score Thank you so much I trusted that smooth talking chap with that cute green tail only to find myself dealing with stupidity to last a lifetime I could say more God I could say a lot more but let me end with this NEVER EVER EVER YOUR THROUGH  
 I am writing this because today I was forced to cancel my policy with due to the fact that year after year they continue to raise my rates for no apparent reason other than   Due to the accidents within your area this is the cause of the increase   as the excuse used for why my rates have increased I have been a loyal customer for well over yrs I have a clean driving record that maintained for at least yrs now and I own my There is no reason my for LIABILITY only has increased by almost since I signed up with this company Nor is there a reason why I should be penalized for other people's driving abilities I even took the time out to call to ask for it to be reduced or re evaluated and was that this was the price basically   so sorry so sad but we do anything for you   So I found a rate with a company that not only beat their rates but also offered me roadside assistance that wanted to charge me additional monies for appalled at the way they have conducted business and how unwilling and unwavering they are in assisting their customers in saving money or more for their money Instead they continue to gouge their customers with ridiculous rates and claim because of the surrounding area I refuse to believe that I have to pay for other people's negligence I feel bad for their poor customer service representatives that have to deal with the disgruntled customers on a daily basis due to their inflexibility to satisfy their customers  
 After I switched to they sent me a letter showing the mileage I I drove each year and the letter indicated I did not need to respond unless the mileage stated in the letter was incorrect I never heard thing about this from them My policy renewed and I was surprised to discover I apparently have a month policy when I had applied for an annual policy and was more surprised to see a % increase in my premium in the auto pay amount which they I had to set up otherwise I would have to pay months in advance for my policy instead of one I called and they me that I should have responded to the letter that email me letter So I them I have a printer so they offered to mail me letter and when I asked they they would not refund the inflated premium I had paid but that they would   adjust   the premium   going forward   I consider this a bait and switch scheme Why should I have to verify that what I them was the truth do it in writing and be penalized if I I him their   letter   should have check boxes and should say in HUGE letters that failure to respond would absolutely result in an increase in premium  
 I was contacted about an accident my y o daughter was involved in Apparently the driver of the other was claiming damages and injuries I explained to the claim investigator that I find it hard to believe there were any injuries since the altercation happened in a school parking lot at a maximum speed of mph Only damage to my daughter's was a bent license plate Only damage to the other was a scratch from the license plate She agreed and asked for pictures and a statement from my daughter We spent the next two weeks playing phone tag but never connected The last time she called I returned her call and left a message explaining that we need to schedule a time to talk since we kept missing each other I no response About two weeks later I sent an email from their claims systems asking for a good time to call so we give her the statement she needed Still I received no response I received a letter in the mail the other day saying that they settled the claim I received a call from our claims investigator and she   We settled because we did not your statement    This is unacceptable has lost my trust and respect and I be changing companies immediately  
 I had been thinking about changing my auto if I could a better rate Let me add that I have an excellent driving record no accidents no legal issues rep indicated that it was necessary to check my credit rating to determine price of Well OK I did refuse to give out my social security number into a non secure situation   No problem we check without my releasing it    After all they have my name address birth date anyway Well all those data were sold I am now receiving solicitations based on my excellent credit rating to borrow money from loan companies I am furious I now have no financial security I have to notify the IRS and credit card companies about this breach I fear the credit card and bank issues that now arise I am furious I be contacting demanding free credit monitoring and compensation I certainly not purchase a product Be warned  
  is a horrible company I was rear ended while stopped at a red light by a insured motorist I was injured and had to go to the hospital for the injuries I had to miss work for a week and now have to go to a chiropractor has stated to me that there was no damage to either which is untrue and that I am not hurt as a result of the accident They denied my claim HORRIBLE COMPANY never recommend them to anyone and always say how bad they handled my claim Negative stars  
Had no problem with them until I changed my payment info They claimed that the payment go thru but bank payment was not sent to account Customer service called me a liar each time I called to have the charge taken off my account Manager also called me a liar even though they reread the emails they sent me When I cancelled my account a customer service me I would have a refund of Instead they gave me and some change They stole the This morning had an email that I owe them Do not do business with these crooked people Ever wonder why companies advertise all the time Their company stinks so need to advertise to try and customers do item 
 In April when I was in the handicap parking a truck hit my rear bumper Supervisor Rachael ** is her number She closed my case I have all the information a picture video she she wanna contact me about taking everything I want an investigation for my accident case And I want to know exactly what made her closed my case  
 I was in an accident that was not my fault The woman I spoke to at me I could file the claim through the other person's or I could go through mine but I would have to pay my deductible I went two days without a because I have the money to pay my deductible and had to go through the other company When I had the estimate on my the woman at the collision center me that people do it all the time I could have filed through the first day and my rental because the deductible would not be due until after all the repairs were done and by then the other would have finished their investigation and took over did not bother telling me none of this they kept saying if I want a rental I have to pay my deductible I had to do all the work contacting the other company all they did was make the initial call My husband called them and they asked if he wanted them to call and try to speed things up Why would they have to ask We have paid every month for years and this is the first time they have been used so what have I been paying them for They are awful Even the adjuster from the other company she would have already had me in a rental and making the calls I was making for me They are awful and only want their payments and want to do  
 Thank heavens I am not currently a customer I have claims on file from and that were zero fault and zero payout In fact neither were actual claims However wants to advertise this false information so that when I shop for other companies see these false claims and want to quote me over % more premiums I called and all they wanted to do is send me a letter that I could show the other companies I am shopping for instead of fixing it the correct way in the system Shame on and you turned me off from ever becoming a customer again  
 Had a no fault accident over a month ago has not settled yet They are giving us the run around Accident was August and   said   they snail mailed a check to the bank Wells Fargo on September st That was weeks post accident We need and our hands are tied until it is settled It is September th month post accident What type of company takes days to settle a claim I have had many carriers over the years but NO has ever treated us so badly The adjuster demonstrates a lackadaisical attitude about our claim while we wait for to finish the process so we buy If the roles were reversed I bet that would not wait for their payment  
 You do an online quote to not deal with the rude agents Gets you nowhere You still have to call them because after you agree to purchase an auto policy and enter your bank information they then change the price and double or triple it Waste of time Do not trust them at all I left last year because after years with them and my first accident and they were horrible rude unprofessional and refused to use them again I now pay elsewhere Saying this is your purchase price and change it afterwards cannot be trusted If you have an accident they are not on your side either When you complain about the rude customer service after an accident you a manager who is even worse They have definitely gone downhill  
 My was dinged on the driver lock in August Thinking I had full coverage I called to put in a claim however when I added comp AND collision in April they only added comp I corrected THEIR mistake and added collision Approximately month later my was hit again causing more damage Now they want my phone records pulling up police locator photos accusing me of fraud They do not want to pay for repairs Want me to come in make statement under oath Making threats sucks rid of both auto and rental They should be ashamed been driving since Never had a claim in my life  
I had a terrible experience with I was stuck in Grand Canyon region in the night with my rental not starting I needed road side assistance and when I called up they the road side assistance work on rental outside Texas I am very disappointed with as this is not true My friend who was in a similar situation with me on the same night was provided road side assistance but I was denied I am definitely moving on to some other unless decides to apologize and make up for this 
 Had my rear glass broken by someone and then called to file a claim A female agent there me that after the deductible would pay the rest of labors and would also pay for parts if the glass is irreplaceable anywhere else than the dealership when I decided to go through dealership rather than with their glass shop However the next agent me that they never so and refused to pay me anything give up right after this is over and recommend it to anyone anymore  
 We have been with for years and been a pleasure up until now When our was stolen from our driveway we contacted as soon as we found out Instead of providing empathy and a sense of support and urgency the theft department badgered us and made us feel like we were the enemy It seems as if they are trying to find a way to avoid us a disabled veteran they demeaned my disability and take my concerns seriously Me and my wife are having to figure out what we are to do from here We understand the due diligence but it should be carried out with tact and urgency Tiffany ** and her supervisor Katy ** ruined our entire outlook with horrible experience After police recovered our we called and left messages at to no avail Katy me to repair the out of pocket but online procedures says someone is supposed to look at it first Basically we have contact with them when someone like Katy does return our call they   cant give us any information   We know when to expect the next step I have called all across in attempt to a different claims rep but unfortunately Katy and Tiffany in Tuscon AZ are the end line for us nightmare  
 On July th and July th I sent two separate checks to for the purpose of applying them to my auto policy I was endeavoring to pay an extra month in order to have the flexibility of using my bill pay policy is to be paid a month in advance if a customer wants to have that control I preferred being able to have the control of when my premium came out of my checking account so I proceeded to pay the additional month's premium Unfortunately the premium being sent to had our Travelers Home Owners account number on it When received the checks and noticed it had the Travelers Policy number on it they then proceeded to route or the two check to Travelers but kept the other one Travelers found the check that forwarded and then sent me a refund of that st check in the mail Now I am that neither or Travelers find the additional that my bank has verified they received Each patently blames the other for   misplacing   my check In the mean time I had to come up with an additional payment out of my pocket to reinstate my auto coverage The second check was supposed to cover that My bank here in Idaho Falls made the comment that they have   never had a company lose a check like that before especially since it showed they cashed it    I have been a customer of for over years but I am now shopping around for a company that not lose the money I send them This is bizarre and wrong on so many levels  
 Our daughter is in my husband's name Our daughter had an accident gave use the run around Customer service was rude After phone calls back and forth they finally that they would mail my husband check but I am so glad after yrs with my husband switch to Nationwide My daughter still has After this is over she be switching to the Nationwide as well is the worse I never recommend them to no one Customer Service's rude the staff is rude claims adjuster are rude They need to be on the news for the word service and I think I be contacting a tv news organization to tell them how rude they are to customers  
When someone ran into the Riverton Community Food Bank Van in a parking lot and left a dent behind the right wheel above the bumper It would cost about They refused to pay Before the police report was completed they had already made their decision Please do not this rip off They use all their money on Stupid commercials instead of Customer service 
Two things They are not listening what customer is requesting They kept my call on hold for almost like min which is too bad I requested a quote after I moved Tennessee and I called customer service since I wanted to discuss few things about cancellation policy and all Representative took that into different way that I am to cancel my policy for sure For that whole conversation I never mentioned I am to cancel my policy but she took that wrong way I tried requesting her but she did not respect me at all Worst customer care I have ever seen 
 The worst company to file a claim with Someone hit my and because it is an older they want me to pay for what they call   betterment    It my fault so the person who caused the damage should be paying even if they have their own client pay the difference They say up to us to file a claim against their client to the difference This would be for all of us who have Please check on this thing called   betterment    You might find yourself facing this paying out of pocket or someone taking you to court for the differences that your fault may be good for some things I know but customer services one If I could give no stars I would  
 This company has turned out to the worst customer service I have ever ever received I had for years plus and never ever had this experience in my entire life Spoke with supervisor and he was worse I never deal with again because a cust svc rep misunderstood the information which I asked the supervisor to please check the recorded call to verify she documented my information incorrectly he did nothing to help the situation despite my long term history with this company I am now recommending everyone to go with any other other than absolutely horrible  
 I decided to try when my current company increased the rate for the next renewal period just because of following the general trend of rising premiums I have any accident or other policy changes The rate I from for a full coverage policy was indeed lower by about % as they advertise So I called to complete a purchase and provided my credit card number to an agent to pay for a month period in full On the next day I email from that my payment was not approved by the credit company Chase and I need to make a   replacement payment   online or through the phone I did immediately within an hour contact Chase to find out that the expiration date provided in the bill was wrong It turned out that Chase have sent me a new card with renewed expiration date Then I call to make a   replacement payment   with a different card but they me the policy was already cancelled due to the   non payment   I asked if they reissue the same policy again and me they would have to charge me of the reissuing fee even as their email mention anything about the policy cancellation And they refused to waive this fee even as it was a simple mistake with a credit card expiration date coincidentally renewed by Chase They me it is the general policy So if their policy is so strict that they starting to charge new customers additional fees even for a clear mistake what could happen when I would have to make a claim for a few thousand of coverage I was completely pissed off by such attitude and decided to continue with my old company even if their rate is slightly ~ % higher And lost a customer with credit score and years of free accident driving history  
 I have insured home and auto with for years Recently I moved and gave them my new address to change policy location They put me with Homesite for homeowners After being in my home for a month I received a letter from telling me that my homeowners would be cancelled because of debris on roof a limb touching the home and a spot of dry rot The limb was part of an untrimmed shrub the so called debris was leaf matter that we had not gotten to yet we have been replacing all floors The dry rot was not dry rot it was compromised masonite which had deteriorated in a singly spot near the chimney I called and them to cancel all my policies homeowners and auto The rep me she would do that and me what my homeowners refund would be I was never I needed to provide a written request to the auto cancelled but was left with the impression that I was talking to someone who was cancelling all my policies Well auto took my next payment out and when I called to question whether the policy was cancelled I was   no    I was at that point I needed to write a request to do that I complained about their dismal customer service and was they would cancel but would charge me an early termination fee I asked to speak to a manager who would not help me John from the Fredericksburg VA office He stonewalled me and refused to not charge me the penalty When I asked him to pass me to his superior he me it was Friday and no was available I went back and forth telling him that in a company of size there is always someone higher He repeated there was no above him I could speak to It was only when I asked his name and the office he worked in that I was quickly passed to someone who helped me Oh and when I called the first time to see how the at Homesite their info and whether I could a few days extension they no and me that Homesite was an affiliate and that the underwriters were not part of the corp but that I would need to contact Homesite directly So much for stop shopping I am now with a different insurer You could not pay me to even consider again  
I am with for about years and yesterday when I try to file a claim about my accident the way they handle the claim is very bad The supervisor is very rude His name is Steven ** I want to talk to someone from corporate office 
The best customer service I had with was when I called to cancel my policy due to bad customer service I had hit a deer late friday night on the interstate and the representative I spoke to was so robotic and non sympathetic I was I would be contacted by Adam but not till Monday between the times of am to pm Completely inconvenient seeing as I was on a camping trip I hear from Adam on Monday so I sent a message On Tuesday I missed a call and immediately called back and reached his voicemail I called times everyday on vacation First time I finally spoke to someone was on Thursday when I called again and Alex was taking Adams calls because he stepped away from his desk What a coincidence I went to because they pride themselves on customer service I guess I was ignorant to believe their commercials I never do business with them again 
 Worst company ever Spare yourself I was rear ended by of their insurers He was cited by the police and they assumed full responsibility They offered to pay my loss of wages due to me not being able to work for the five weeks it took to my fixed I currently driving for Ride share companies after being laid off I have submitted over here documents regarding my pay including weekly AND daily pay stubs and they are still saying they need more documentation They have even went as far as to say they are to cut my overhead by subtracting out money for gas that they feel I need to this month They've Changed my rental from a comparable SUV to a compact At point they even pulled my day rental reservation telling me I only had a hour pass My truck is in jeopardy of being repoed and my apartment complex is to evict me They have no care in the world How am I losing everything when I am in no way at fault When I reached out to the insurer who's been very helpful and apologetic they flat out lied to him saying I am choosing to not work Absolutely disgusting  
 Initially I signed up for auto in June of switching from Nationwide which I should have stayed with Originally I signed up for full coverage with everything included Then for whatever reason I needed to call so I did Began speaking to a customer service rep who to   save me money   dropped all my coverage to liability only I him I want liability only but he he would transfer me to person after me liability I agree but OK Then after my initial set up I transferred to rep who supposedly added my coverages back Come to find out no she left off rental reimbursement and accident forgiveness Now in July was involved in a crash and called to report a claim was found at fault for taking evasive action to avoid rear ending a that stopped in front of me when I find out my coverages were not put on my policy called week after week and have gotten put on hold been hung up on and given the runaround Customer service rep was laughing under her breath find the call of initial coverages when they are supposed to be recorded and have been there is nothing I do except add the coverages from this point forward Extremely disappointed and frustrated and do not want them insuring me any longer  
 Conflicting Information and Promises EMERGENCY ROAD SERVICE is not for anything but a   tow a battery boost a tire change if you have a spare and a gallon of gas    That is what I was today I asked for roadside service to open my hood They offered to tow it but would not send someone to open the hood So they would spend over for a tow but not the same to pop a hood open I have to wonder whose best and fiduciary interest the premium is paid for  
 I called to auto for I asked them right when I was about to pay to prepare for next year when my son have his license what the policy cost look like And what they did blew my mind they added him to the policy and increased the cost of my premium He drive right now due to an accident and by the time he drive his learner's permit be expired But according to they have to add him because he has a learner's permit B S This is way for them to charge extra So I asked to speak to their manager yes you guessed it he available Not even seconds passed before those words were coming out of her mouth Good thing there are soooo many other companies to spend my money with  
 I called July th and asked how much months on my policy would be The rep asked me if I moved and I yes and gave her my new address She the cost of the policy had changed but not by much I live less than miles from my former address She me the new price for the months and I paid it A few days later I an email from saying my payment was declined I went to my bank account and it showed the payment had cleared Puzzled I called and the rep find where the month payment been declined It was showing as paid Then she says that she sees that I was on MONTHLY payments and it was that payment for the th was declined by the bank on the nd I her I am not on monthly payments I always pay the months all at once I became concerned that I actually had policies because I knew something was wrong She checked and no it was the same policy number and even tho I had been paying them the full cost every six months ALL THIS TIME I was on a monthly payment plan with the extra a month fee with bank account info for a account that had been closed for ages I her I never approved of the monthly payments out of ANY account and when I asked the rep on the th for the amount of the months she took my new address and gave me my new price for the policy Nothing was about a pending month payment and how that would affect the price I was to pay A rep say   Your policy amount has changed to ____ and today we have a pending debit for ____ so the balance to pay it off today would be ____   How could she not tell you about a pending payment and how it would affect what you are paying No sound right I asked for a supervisor He there was nothing he could do He was sorry for   inconvenience   of the original rep putting me on payments but I had to pay the NEW AMOUNT I WAS NEVER but I have to pay the balance until the end of the year I gave up and let it to that Now I an email saying that I have to pay by August th Of course I am hot I call and explain that even tho I do not feel I owe this payment there was nothing anyone could do so I was I have to make it until the end of the year It is a hardship for me since I am not working right now I am by the rep to IGNORE any cancellation emails and mail I may because they are computer generated and I have paid for months I have ZERO trust right now and am afraid I call after the th and find out I am cancelled He send me something saying I cancelled but he did send a copy of my policy and in the notes wrote that the policy was in effect until Nothing saying it be cancelled for non payment The comment below where he wrote this say that it is only effective up until the day it was sent today and after it could change so this any sort of proof I be cancelled Every time I had a I always because they helped me once when my license was suspended for not having by company because I had switched to It was a mistake on their part but that rep called Tallahassee and had my driver's license reinstated in mins I have lost all my faith in them because of the way this was handled Now I have to find a new company by the first of the year  
 I am extremely dissatisfied and feel that I have been cheated by # When you use roadside assistance YOUR PREMIUM GOES UP Mine increased more than % no accidents no tickets ever With the terribly cold winter I needed a recharge to my battery to start my Each call put me in a higher risk pool #IHATE  
 I plan to relocate to state and called to a quote After being transferred around an agent changed my policy to the new state at while I am paying right now I was shocked and asked her why she did it without my authorization She I need to it as soon as I move so she cancelled my current policy too I called a few other companies to ask about it they all I keep my current policy for days out of state I called back to my old policy back but they refused to do so The experience is so frustrating to compare AAA quoted me for the same policy  
 I called regarding the windshield replacement They me I choose whatever dealer I want and deductible Then I scheduled an appointment and called again and them it be including part fee and labor fee They they only reimburse me and only advised me to use their recommended service which use the cheapest glass and hr labor fee What a liar and I even talked with their manager which is even rude and they really care about you  
 I was about to pull into a parking spot at the local hospital when I noticed the driver beside had started to back up I immediately laid on my horn and watched in horror for entire seconds while this driver continued to back right into me I was absolutely furious because she did it very slowly so it like she have time to react to my horn and it was very loud Once she realized what she had done she out of the and I asked her pretty angrily     you hear my horn    to which she proceeded to deny Needless to say we went back and forth before exchanging information The following day I repeatedly kept phone calls from her which was asking for my statement for the accident her representative even left a voicemail saying that I could call and leave a voicemail with my statement I want to do that because I have always been that you are supposed to give your statement to your own company and they send your statement to the other driver's I called my and let them know that stop calling me and bugging me for my statement and they worry about it we send it to them About two weeks after the accident I received a letter in the mail from stating they had finished their   investigation   of the accident and they found ME % at fault for the accident I had to read the letter about times to make sure I was seeing things correctly First off like to know how on earth it is possible for someone who gets hit because driver backs into them I mean what if I was a child on a bike all driver's supposed to look behind them before they back up I always do this driver clearly and she must be hard of hearing if she hear me blasting my horn from the second her reverse lights came on So you put whatever the heck you want on your little letters to the drivers you claim are   at fault   if it makes you feel better or makes your drivers look like good drivers but that hospital has a security camera footage that says otherwise  
 In March I paid for coverage through September In June I requested an online price quote Instead of a price quote automatically decided to add my grandson as a driver to my policy I ONLY WANTED A QUOTE Now I am receiving a cancellation notice I previously called and discussed the matter with the service representatives I was I would receive an exclusion form through email As of today no such form has been sent I was also I could find the exclusion form on their website I have yet to locate it I was I couldn’t insure my own with them since my grandson obtained on it with company Basically they removed the from my policy which leaves ME uncovered when I drive that In order to obtain coverage I would have to be added to his policy He only uses the to drive to college each day This be my last transaction for coverage with in September What a lousy unethical company I have been a customer over years I am so glad my eyes have been opened  
 I spoke with guy name Nick at in the bodily claim in regard my medical claim who discriminate and insulted me over the phone because I have an accent saying   this ** asking for pillow and mattress and he forgot that he's been sleeping on the floor for his entire life This ** like the giving for his pain and suffering and asking for more and forgot he never had penny on him before    
 In December my was stolen and found in a ditch with ~ worth of damage dragged their feet on the entire process which resulted in me being without a for over months I had no communication from regarding this claim and had to learn everything through the body shop I had chosen After asking several times reiterated that I could pick a body shop of my choosing with no limitations however when it came time to pay the claim it refused to pay the labor rates charged by body shop never disclosing this to me which further exacerbated the length of time it took to repair my Further the manpower handling my claim was totally unorganized and unprofessional The adjuster sent out was   covering   for the local adjuster The claim person my claim was assigned to never answered her phone and she did not know pertinent information to my claim so I was forced to contact the supervisor who was less than friendly I have had coverage for over years had filed claims before and always had a good experience It is a sad state of affairs when due to a large claim their good reputation with me when a good company is needed the most falls way below average There was absolutely no apology or compassion when I stated how incredibly disappointed I was with their handling of this claim and how I had been a paying holder for years and would be forced to gain coverage elsewhere Not only did I pay my deductible but had to pay in additional labor costs that would not cover and for adding coverage on a loaner not a rental Further now that this claim is finally over with I am able to file a theft claim to my deductible back For this I needed some information from I had to e mail the auto damage Supervisor numerous times to simple information which you would think they would be happy to provide to regain my faith in them needs to have direct communication with their customers should treat the handling of EVERY claim whether large or small the same I was extremely disappointed with and be looking for and property elsewhere  
 I was hit by a guy that had So they want to pay my claim OK tell me how a man gets that even have a driver's license Then hits my and they not pay And whatever you do Shante ** She thinks it is ok for people to drive hit someone new and need to pay WITH NO DRIVER'S LICENSE  
 Well it has been since and has still not refunded my waiver fee for an accident I was not at fault Since the DWI driver with suspended license and no coverage has yet to claim responsibility I see my refund for possibly years Each time I have called they give me the fine print legalize in the policy and tell me there is nothing they do till they hear from an company the driver claims to have Wow very convenient I wonder why I wasted all that money for the extra protection for this kind of event After over years with and no claims filed this is how they take care of their of the best members you get They could care less about you when it comes to   money out of their pocket   or should I say   my money out of their pocket   After all I pay more than the in the waiver It is with sincerity that I highly do not recommend this company It has been the most frustrating and time consuming back and forth since I had to deal with First American Home protection last year Go to AAA not Yes they cost a bit more but they pay immediately and have so many customer support programs If I could rate negative stars I would  
 Approximately months ago I retained auto through On Friday I received a letter from them stating that a recent motor report shows that my driver's license is currently under suspension They state that I need to contact the Dept of Motor to reinstate it and send proof to them that it is by or they cancel my policy I called them knowing this was not true The woman who answered put me on hold to recheck this mistake When she returned she me THAT IT WAS SUSPENDED I knew this was not true and the DMV was closed so I called local law enforcement and asked questions It was their opinion also that had made a mistake I called again and I demanded answers from the individual who answered next After putting me on hold for a lengthy period she returned She me that they had made a mistake and that my license was not suspended and apologized For the stress that you have put me through and for your untrustworthiness unprofessionalism poor business ethics You cannot be trusted On I no longer use your services and find a local company If you make mistakes like this I fear what could happen if I were to ever be involved in an accident I recommend that no use YES you reimburse me the moneys that I have paid you for additional months after and I be filing a state level complaint against  
 I have been with about a year and tried to add my son's using the online tools at the end of May When we went to register the the second week in July it turned out the was not on the policy whoops Okay I am sure that was my fault missed a button or whatever but seems like they should be able to see that we made the effort to add it if they look up access records In any case we immediately added it once we realized the miss this was July th you know there was a hail storm the next day right where my son works so his damaged My husband initiated a claim using the online tools and apparently chose my instead of my son's one is BMWX and is BMWX so when we went to the estimate for repairs it was a different than the identified in the initial request I blame for being suspicious weird that we had a claim the day after we added coverage but heck it like I could predict a hail storm Anyway they called us and asked for all kinds of proofs and the claim is pending review This I understand but what really bothers me is that while they are hassling us they stopped payment on the claim check we had already received and deposited without telling us they were doing so If a claim is in dispute I understand holding payment but there needs to be communication It also so happens that we did indeed have a that caught in a hail storm the day after it was added to the policy but for the amount of trouble and angst this has caused it is hardly worth the amount of money in question Not to mention that I am sure our rates are to skyrocket

 My claim adjuster neglected to call the garage my automobile was towed to The garage was waiting for a call from to contact them before repairs were made I had hit a deer and the damage was minor The appraisal of my that I would only have a five day repair I had rental coverage for days On the day before that was to end the adjuster called to tell me to return the rental This is how I found out nothing was happening because he had no clue the status of repairs I was although the rental coverage had ended would offer me a discounted rate on the rental for continued usage Three days later the rental company left a voicemail saying they would report the stolen because once again had failed to contact them I returned the rental immediately in immense fear and proceeded to call for help I have been by many representatives that there is nothing they do and they have been so awful as to claim that it was my fault My claim was mishandled Sixty days later the is still not repaired and Enterprise rental has charged my debit card so much as to overdraft my bank account twice  
 My son has had for several years and was paying a month for a and last week he had an accident which was his fault Now he finds out the adults inside the were not covered for injuries Any minors inside would have been covered but no adults were If had been involved anyone in those would have been covered but NO adults inside his were covered I have never heard of such a thing I thought FULL coverage was full coverage a month is not cheap This is outrageous and I cannot believe our government allows these companies to do this READ YOUR POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE it is TOO LATE I would have given them no stars if I could  
 I was involved in a three accident with my being the in the front of the chain and the last to rear ended In Oregon where I live state law allows drivers who have been involved in an accident to their repaired where they choose We do not have to go to of the sketchy places recommended by the companies The person who caused the accident I was in has through The first two people I spoke with at were very friendly but they were both misleading and dishonest I the first person I spoke with that I wanted my repaired at   my   shop that I am familiar with not the shop they recommended The first person OK but I HAD to take my to their shop for an appraisal and that shop could see me the next day When I the email confirming the details the email I was to drop my off at the shop they recommended and leave it there for repairs I called them back to correct this The next person I spoke with was equally nice but she also I HAD to take my to their recommended shop for an appraisal even if that shop do the repair The adjustor would meet me at that shop do the appraisal and would cut a check to me at that time for the amount of the appraisal and that would be the end of it Unfortunately now that I my repaired at their recommended shop the appraiser be able to see my for two weeks I the rep that I comfortable with them cutting me a check for whatever the appraiser might come up with because who knows what the actual repair costs would be Silence on her part I made the appointment for an appraisal for two weeks in the future and then promptly called my repair shop They they have appraisers come in to their shop every day to do appraisals and I do NOT have to take my to recommended shop for an appraisal I was hoping that would be the end my dealings with but denied the pre and post electronic control module scans my shop does when they repair a My shop they offer a warranty on the work without the scans and unless I wanted to pay for them myself I would need to call to see if they would cover the scans I left FOUR messages for the appraiser and message for the appraiser's supervisor and no ever called me back I was shocked when I tried the supervisor's number more time and he actually answered sure he would say he was completely professional during the phone call but I found him to be condescending rude and very frustrating At this point if I want a warranty on the work done to my have to pay several hundred dollars for the scans Several hundred dollars I have For an accident that my fault If I ever see that little gecko he's not to come out of our interaction looking very well And to make sure everyone I know does not through  
 I have had company for over years but due to an increase not due to my perfect driving record but to my ZIP Code I an increase I was at first foolishly drawn into how much lower rates were than everyone else Luckily I did not start my coverage right away In the two days since I ordered the coverage I had four encounters with their customer service all of which I feel like the Kardashians would've done a better job First I called the local number so I could my inspected even though their inspection report if you've had continuous coverage for more than two years it is not needed And had it for years but I figured what the heck I go take it there I called the local office number and a girl answered and before I could even tell her what I wanted which was basically to ask what hours they were open for the inspection she kept saying   you need customer service    And I   but no if you wait and let me tell you what I need   and of course she would not and she transferred me to the voice tier from hell which takes at least minutes to through and the robot never understands anything you are saying Once I screamed at the robot for about minutes it finally understood that I want to speak to a live person but I think the live person was not even as intelligent as the robot Then I disconnected and had to go back to the voice tier Then I a fairly nice person who she was sorry she did not know why they transferred me to customer service I did need to talk to the local office and she would call them herself for me and ask them if they were open and if I need an appointment which of course the first person at the local office could've done to begin with if they want to listen to me Then as others on here have commented when I had to call back again for something else I a person who had no idea what they were talking about And I asked them   can you send me that in writing    and they   I now I have to put you on hold and ask my supervisor    At that point I thought I have not even gotten an accident yet had to use them or even my policy I had had enough I that person   forget about it my policy is not in effect 'til next month I still have my current auto I want you cancel my policy I care if my other would be times your price had excellent service for years not into the hell    I was saved in the nick of time in my old agent was very professional as always as were all the people in his office They immediately corrected everything make sure that I back as a current customer since I had a cancellation notice I had put in for days since I was switching companies I him I not switch I care what the prices were at My advice if you avoid this company I would do it in my opinion If you want to drive yourself crazy to save or a month then you might have to try it like I thought I did But I cut back somewhere else I not cut back on my sanity If it was this bad before they even had to do anything how bad would it be when I really needed them They kept telling me they had the highest customer satisfaction rating of any company Well I know if they do or they but from what I have read here and on other sites online I certainly do not see that to be the case Either way I would rather set myself on fire and put it out with the tack hammer than ever go back to  
My wife was in an accident in which the other driver was at fault was the other driver's company I called and spoke with Michael in claims whom I later found out he was the supervisor in this department He was so disrespectful and inconsiderate He would not take the time to listen to my concerns Every time I tried to talk and explain the situation he insisted on trying to over talk me and not allow me to explain the incident Not sure how he was trained but pretty sure he needs some remedial training In the future Michael need to learn how to be patient and understand that the people on the other end of the phone had an accident and that is the reason why he still have a job 
 My first accident in years of driving I was hit from behind by a truck on the expressway % not at fault My was destroyed offered me less than my was worth it was best they could offer My lawyer called the truck company and in two days I had reimbursement for my MORE than offered I reimbursed for lost wages for months They are not covering my medical charges in full speak to anyone on the phone because I have a lawyer They are horrible to deal with Fortunately my lawyer is handling everything and the truck company has been great switching ASAP Do not I repeat do not purchase

 I was crossing an intersection and a guy decides to make a left turn in front of me he a citation for failure to yield right of way He happened to have also When I called to make my claim me that I was % at fault that I should be aware of my surroundings and drive more cautiously because I hit the vehicle's rear door I should have been able to avoid him completely and only pay % of my claim THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF I guess to them I should have been walking That way I have gotten in an accident I am investigating some cases I believe there are class action suits against them for this same thing I am dropping them like a hot potato and word of mouth goes a long way I am starting here and if anyone knows where else I write bad reviews on them please let me know ** I have never been so insulted in my life They should lose their license for ripping consumers off  
 Biggest nightmare has put me and my family through the ringer for an accident that my fault My wife was at a red light and hit from behind The other guy's wanted to total it but the guy have enough coverage I had and thought they would take care of me Instead they have put my family and I through the worst experience ever They are doing a whole new frame new bed new front end moving the cab to a new frame and fixing the damage to the cab Over in work They over inflated the value of my so they have to total it I them I feel safe having a body shop   build me a truck   because basically what they are doing and I was the safety of my family his job or responsibility He determines if totaled or not The body shop it would take months to fix after they parts took my rental away before the first part arrived leaving me with a a month rental bill If looking for look elsewhere As soon as my truck is done I am dropping and telling everyone the biggest nightmare they gave me They could have totaled it a month ago and my wife could have been in a new truck and this would all be behind us But no They wanted to screw the customer and drag it out to try and save a I have been that I would a call by end of business days in a row now still no contact to show the customer service level  
  year holder with accident claim history and My Very Basic Non Collision Coverage Auto Policy Premium is still over a year Customer service is the worst I have ever seen or heard in all businesses Better everything to include much lower auto premiums and a lot fewer commercials Boo hoo for You boo hoo for You  
 Recently the local adjuster totaled my The adjuster and his manager were low ballers They valued my very less price than the normal market price I also sent all recent bills of repair with new part replacement but they even consider % of total recent repair cost The repair cost was of all new tire replacement tuning with all new spark plugs new radiator assembly etc Some repair was of weeks before they totaled The adjuster listen keep saying our evaluation is good every time Their evaluation system for total loss was total trash While adjusting the value of they also compared with different model The report shows a listed with thousand more mileage than my is almost equivalent to mine on the other hand the adjusted value comparing with a with slightly less mileage than mine is almost half  
 has been stalling my claim from auto crash It takes poor judgment and a lack of caring about others to attempt to cross lanes in extremely heavy traffic To add insult to injury is taking a minimum coverage claim and treating it as if the suit was a big deal I want these people out of my life and would suggest the same for others be a sucker by choosing 
My wife was in an accident in our brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee with less than miles on it and she at fault as the took a side impact us to let them take the to their partner shop Viverette's on Cassat Ave and we would the back in new condition After days now and attempts by Viverette's the is still not even close to being back in new condition Viverette's even the vehicle's paint and body work right much less the mechanical and suspension issues Aside from the problems with the shop whom is supposed to be our representative through these troubling times and is supposed to be doing quality control on the to make sure we our returned in good working order even looked at the to make sure it is right or even safe for that matter We have spoken to over half a dozen supervisors with and let them know that the is unsafe and still needs to be repaired and each is more dismissive and rude than the other has dropped the ball on this claim and even attempted to pick it back up yet and make this right Not only that but has it in their system as our claim was completed on June th and here it is July th and the is still unsafe to drive as the rear end feels like it is to fall out of the when you hit any type of bump has also authorized their partner shop to use the cheapest means necessary to repair our instance is the vehicle's wheels The wheels is what took the brunt of the impact in the accident and authorized the shop to recondition the wheels as opposed to purchasing new wheels After attempts to recondition the wheels they are still not right and you see visible pitting from them shaving them down so far This is unacceptable from an company 
 Having been a loyal customer of for six years I recently moved and went to renew my policy giving them the new information in the process As a carpenter I occasionally go to individual home sites rather than the large neighborhood where we spend the vast majority of our time Upon hearing this the representative proceeded to take my information and subsequently my money only to inform me that this would be the last period of coverage under the policy I had had for years Why Because and I quote here   You take different routes    I was I would have to carry COMMERCIAL on my private because once in a great while I go in a different direction What if I stop for groceries on the way home I live in a rural area that adds about ten miles to my trip and I take different roads Do I need commercial for that What if I go into town for a movie night Do I need commercial I mean taking a different set of roads Holy mackerel better call and let them know right Loyalty means nothing to these clowns Only your money If I am to have my rates doubled as soon as they find out a blue collar worker what next Charge me more because not married Because I own an older Because I once carried some scrap plywood home for a side project Whatever you do and whoever you know DO NOT TRUST FOR INSTANT They have precisely ZERO INTEREST in their customer's well being or finances ONLY THEIR MONEY Flee Flee from as you would the plague  
 I exited the parking lot after making sure everything was clear and was waiting for traffic to clear at the intersection when a drove really fast past me going the same way and as a result hit my which was not badly hurt However because of her speed her was damaged I called and spoke to the agent who was rude from the start After our conversation he left me message saying that I had to take care of my because of He she and they unable to verify the right information A month I received a letter from stating that I was on the wrong because I did not yield to the other driver Do they know the meaning of YIELD How yield when has stopped and waiting for traffic to clear He kept bullying me into saying that I was in the wrong lane which is not true If I was in the wrong lane so was the other driver I explained that the other driver who was also in the same direction as I was should have waited till I crossed as I was there before her Also the driver who hit my had a DRIVERS PERMIT and her was scratched badly because of the speed she was driving at and my was slightly scratched I have sent them the pictures of both today Frustrated at the way I was treated by agent I left a message for his manager who did not even bother to return my call After weeks I called back and was dealing with someone worst than Daniel agent from When I explained what happened she me that it was a DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER when I her that the other driver was speeding Seriously speaking the truth is defamation of character  
 We were with for a few years Then I had accidents Neither my fault They have to pay out anything A few months later they they were dropping me but they wanted to keep my husband's truck covered They gave me a lame excuse that they cover my small business courier they cover me because I had clients in my for running errands which I We are now cover by Progressive and paying less We have full coverage on two and a boat for less than we paid for the two And to top that off they sent a letter a couple of weeks ago wanting us to with them again When you pay a year and dropped for a no good reason that is very bad business  
 I have started my on th of April the monthly premium was but they charged from my CC And again after month they have increased my monthly premium to And again after month they have increased up to I have cancel the premium after months and different company Auto Furthermore they have charged for cancellation fees I never recommend for anyone this shame company  
 policies do not explain the details of their intent They spend thousands against their own clients My was hit and run while parked and the policy states they cover hit and runs if a case is filed with police claims this only applies if they have an ID on the person who hit and ran In other words when the police investigate and capture the criminal The police not pursue hit and runs unless bodily harm is involved This is a void escape clause that is not presented in the policy document which means a lawyer so their lawyer and your lawyer go have lunch on your premiums time to say goodbye to these liars What makes it worse is a mandatory law to have that is laughing their way to the bank If you have wait to hear excuses Tell they are fired 
 I have been with for over years I never had any problems until I received a letter stating that due to my Red light ticket in and Speeding ticket in I have been excluded from my own policy That is ridiculous I cost them any money I would assume they would ask for more but they I never use them again  
   ever use They cancelled my claiming my license was suspended which never was It was a clerical error on their part After PROVING my license was indeed not suspended they re quoted me per month more than what I was paying and all they was there is nothing they do I was a loyal customer for over years Horrible YOU'VE BEEN WARNED  
 I've been with for over years and my wife was recently in her first accident where she rear ended someone at less than miles per hour All it did to her was break the license plate frame it Easy fix for me luckily She then had two traffic violations for failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign I have no accidents or traffic violations has dumped her from our policy for this at a loss for words as so minor and everyday stuff that I see how they justify it at all I expected a rate hike possibly but if we wanted to keep her on our payment would go from for a half year to Bottom line if you have you better hope a super human and never need to use your even for the most minor incidents and ever a ticket ashamed to have paid these thieves for as long as I did  
I flood damage on my It took weeks to send adjuster to check the I submitted my claim on Until today they have not paid me what we agreed Their people are good in thing to say we are sorry you are right but they help you to solve the problem weeks without a is big thing for people want to work For so what you have to wait The worst company when they have to pay you for your loss 
 First I was a faithful customer for over years When my wife and I added our daughter to our policy she ended up being involved in accidents within years After all that I ended up in a DUI but absolutely nothing else When I relocated from California to NC I notified a month prior At no point did the representative express any concern for the driving record of my daughter as applied to my own record Thus I was issued a SR and began full coverage for my wife and me and my DUI At first the monthly premium was reasonable per month After we moved to NC we received a bill stating that we owed per month from now on as monthly premiums Utterly ridiculous When I contacted I was that the new rate was because the accidents of my daughter were my accidents because I was the calling in to report all three Regardless of the fact that I involved nor the cause  
 I had a bump in a Home Depot parking lot The other guy was a serial offender at least abrasions on his bumper The mark I made was so small I could have buffed it out with my spit rated me and now my went up % with ALL companies an accident Hahaha they are criminals they put their customers LAST  
 Have insured and houses with this company When I found that of the had flat tire I called the roadside assistance and learned that it has expired due to the age So I went and add bought the roadside from to both of my When I called the company they refused the service due to the fact that I bought the service after the fact Remembering that the last and the only accident where the other side definitely was at fault did not resolved and I had to pay for the repair myself I am changing the company and my recommendations are do not waste your money on  
 Very poor company to do business This is the worst company in USA Very poor customer service This company would not pay you your claim and demand many many information that are very old and not relevant to the I recommend anyone to use the service You regret to use the service for which you paid for This company has not two of my hit and run accident You have to be very careful with buying policy with this company If you are involved in any type of accident this company keep asking you multiple recorded statement to contradict your previous recorded statement to deny payment I am taking this company to court in a very near future As for my rating to this I rate negative  
 My daughter was sitting at a stop sign when a driver slammed into the front of her Based on witness accounts the driver of the other was cited for failure to control speed even though he stated a had turned in front of him I viewed the dash cam video from my daughters and there was a the barely pulled into his lane but he was not paying attention and hit his brakes too late and lost control of his Cut and dry my daughter clearly not at fault The police officer pulled us in and stated the blame was fully on the other driver due to his failure to control his He would not allow us to the contact information for the driver that pulled into the lane again stating that it was solely the responsibility of the driver to control their This is where the story gets strange The other driver and my daughter are both insured by I immediately open a claim but the agent on the phone opened it against my not the other driver's It continued to even stranger as I stated I did not want it opened on my account that it was the other driver's fault They then asked me if I wanted my fixed or not Uh Of course I do So they stated it would be opened on my account I would pay the deductible and they would try to my deductible back Huh I uploaded the requested pictures of my and the dash cam video showing it was clearly not my daughter's fault showing the turning barely into the other drivers lane then the slamming into my daughter's so hard that it lifted the front off the ground and turned degrees speed limit was in a construction zone So my claim rep explained that nothing would be shared with the other claim that was finally opened on the other driver's coverage I received a call a few days later stating that had determined the other driver was only % at fault and in Texas they do not have to pay if they seem they are not more than % responsible I asked why and they the dash cam video showed their driver was avoiding driver First of all the other driver was not far in the lane second how did you the video She would not state how she had access other than stating it was in your claim I reiterated the police report stated the other driver was at fault and he was cited for failure to control speed Return response from the agent was   prove it    I produced the police report days later She again stated the police officer was wrong and he could not determine speed and they still determined they were only % at fault Well after over weeks in the shop my repair shop stated this was the worst damage they had seen on a that was not totaled They also complained about lack of responsiveness to claims Only about weeks worth of work but the time was spent waiting on to respond I now take it up with the Texas Department of Low rates for a reason  
 At this morning I called number for roadside assistance At sent me a text that the tow trucks ETA was At pm I called the number again At I received a new text with a new ETA of then it was then it was The tow truck came and took my home but very dissatisfied that I waited over hrs in degree heat  
 BEWARE Is the worst company It has been a nightmare since we into our accident In November we were out of state and rear ended twice never contacted us and when we did to file the claim they never called back When we had contacted the they treated us like we were the   the bad guy    I guess by chance we had gotten the and shortly in an accident Before taking action they they had to verify the accident with the others parties involved What the hell We are the ones who pay the premiums and you are to take someone else's word over ours Made no sense I   well lady arrested because she aggressive and the other person speak English So perhaps speak to the policeman who took the report    I never had heard of that That is stupidity and made me feel like my account was worthless Referred us to the worst auto body shop that when they   fixed our bumper   they failed to connect our break lights and they almost caused us to rear ended AGAIN We never received our deposit back from the shop and the job was done so crappy that the sides of our bumper is now sticking out So because of their HORRIBLE SERVICE we a lawyer So eventually we met with a representative and OMG it felt like I was being interrogated for committing a crime We were asked very personal questions He started probing about our living situation and who owned the property we were in He demanded we provide a name and number of the person who owned the home we were in It had nothing to do we OUR ACCIDENT I ALMOST CRIED BECAUSE I FELT LIKE ANYTHING I WAS BEING TURNED AROUND AGAINST ME They are our company we pay their paycheck yet they treated us like the criminals I be switching companies asap  
 I cannot believe that because I owned an older which only had liability and I bought a newer that my even give me full coverage for the drive home I was hit by driver literally within minutes of purchasing the which I prove from my registration print off and the incident report from the police The other driver was not cited It was a   he she accident   I come home only to find out that only extend liability to my new which help me I have been accident free for over years and received a ticket in over years too I have been a loyal customer to for years and when I need and expect my to at least cover me for the drive home and give me time to call them to add the and adjust my policy you leave me out in the cold This is a true tale of have little companies care about their customers and how hard they work to avoid actually covering anyone I literally spend the rest of my life telling people to avoid  
 I was hit by who failed to merge when his lane ended due to construction he felt he could swing over A fine customer Police reports and interviews ensue with the outcome of the rep saying   Well even with the evidence presented we feel both accounts could be true So therefore we're to side with our customer    What How do you sleep at night knowing what really happened yet did the wrong thing I am embarrassed for What an incredible lack of integrity Looking forward to my company battling your horrible decision DO NOT use  
 I called a week before my payment was due to set up a new billing date Everything went fine and I was that I would have to start a new billing cycle that was now higher Whatever I left it alone I received an email that morning stating my new date and the amount of which would be taken that day A week and a half later I checked my debit card as I often do and found that the only I had to my name was gone After reviewing my account I came to find out that had taken the payment days earlier than they were supposed to They took it the st not the th as per the changes I had made and as my email confirmation had stated When I called them I was that it matter what I was or what my email read that the payment was already processed before the phone call to change my billing date I argued and cussed and was continually that there was nothing they could do and even if I was right it would take two weeks to put the money back They also me for them to put the money back I would have to produce that same payment from debit card at this time How does that even make sense is a fraudulent company and steals from their   customers   They processed a debit payment from my account with no permission to do so because they could I then went online and tried to change my information so they have my account info and end my automatic payment arrangements I was then prompted to pick a new billing cycle and since I was no longer enrolled in the auto pay system my payments would now be more Wtf When I started with I was warned by others that they are crap and that their coverage is also crap but I chose them anyway because the price was unbeatable Now I know why They are thieves Literally thieves I be finding a new company This happened about an hour ago and I am literally counting the minutes to off of work to switch companies If there is ever a lawyer who takes the massive lawsuit against this company I want in on it Not for the money but because they need to be stopped immediately How is what they do legal  
My claim involved the front windshield which started with a chip and ended with a crack a day later The windshield was scheduled to replace and I was by the representative to take it to a dealer and I would be responsible on paying for the repairs out of my pocket minus the deductible it recorded conversation Once the was repaired and I submitted all the necessary reimbursement paperwork I was that my claim be reimbursed in full due to the fact their labor reimbursement and aftermarket limit was way less than what I paid I drive a BMW in which you install a simple aftermarket windshield required to have a hud and rain sensors I was that the representative documented on my claim that I was informed that I would be reimbursed for an aftermarket windshield and hr labor which was simply not true A responsible shopper on a fixed income to waste on a windshield if there are less expensive options available If able to have the representative arrested for falsifying documents and willfully misleading me into having me repair my at the dealership when there were different options available I would be satisfied in pursuing this employee to reimbursed for my difference in cost that covered 
 I do not have The person who totaled my fence did It happened weeks ago They me they needed the police report additional days Once I received it and called them to give it to them they stated it necessary Yet still waited for their customer the guy who hit my fence to tell them it happened the way the police report indicated Weird Now waiting they stated the check go to the contractor yeah no Never pay a contractor prior to the work being done and really none of their business When it first happened they stated days now two weeks later they stated weeks in addition to the time lapsed already Thank goodness I have them and do my best to let others know You really know your company until you know them Always do due diligence when selecting companies After reading the nightmares experienced by their own customers I truly understand why this company gets away with what they do Every conversation that I have had has been totally different from the before At least your scripts together people  
  is the most deceitful company I have ever had the displeasure of working with I was misled from the beginning starting with my quote that I received from Amber ** of the South Blvd office in Charlotte NC ** AUTO as well as the agency owner of that location I have her name or info I was forthright when I gave my information and stated that I had a speeding ticket in late Conviction date of When Amber ran the quote she the ticket did not show up and gave me a monthly quote of something and some change I tweaked the coverage since the original quote to bring the monthly rate to and some change I was very satisfied with this and counted myself lucky that the ticket did not show up even though again I provided this information up front I was obviously very upset when I was contacted about a month after I had agreed to the service and subsequently locking me in to service with for six months and that the rate would be up to per month increase of roughly per month I was that the MVR was pulled again and the ticket was now showing up I tried to talk to countless other employees only to be that they were allowed by law to do this and would not be adjusting the rate although it was their mistake This is a textbook BAIT AND SWITCH How you lock someone in to service at rate and change it a month later with no new information After all of this I decided that I to stand for this and the behemoth that is would not profit off of my measly account I began to shop my at other agencies I found a smaller independent brokerage that is actually honest and cares about their clients which is a welcomed sight after so much dishonesty and deceptive practices and they be my new provider When I called to cancel notified me as if they hadn't done enough already that I would be charged an early termination fee even though they were the dishonest and deceptive ones When I asked for this to be waived I was that they were unwilling to do that I was given a breakdown of the charges for coverage through the st of June and for the early cancellation fee When I complained to Facebook page I was something completely different I was that there is no early cancellation fee only a   short rate   for cancelling early The associate even pointed it out on an NC document I guess they think that I would read the document because it that they would charge the short rate on top of a cancellation fee When I called my local agency to have them waive the fee they that they could not do it because the   fee   was charged by the state This is three different things from three different employees All of them gave me the run around and me they would have a supervisor call me which none of them did I honestly have no idea how this be legal It might not be but is so big that they could not care less They probably it away with it either way  
 So Auto has decided that I am at fault for the damage to my They came to that conclusion after reading the accident report that that the other driver was at fault and after they asked her why she hit me She them I was speeding so why Truth is I was slowing down to make the next turn when she hit me and she never slowed down trust  
  is the joke of I have ever heard of My brother had it and never had a claim until a hail storm When looked at his truck and it was totaled dollars damage then they him that they were to only pay him and take the truck I am a dealer and this truck for the shape and miles was worth over and would bring at the auction but even pay poor condition I have him to drop and to tell everyone about how they rip people off what a worth company  
 The representative that set up my account first copied my email address incorrectly So I receive any information until later He also me I would be charged for my initial setup on the st then again at my regular rate on the th I was charged on the st and the st And incurred a returned check fee for the completely unexpected payment No was willing to make this right Logan connected my with his supervisor Holly who also she could not correct this I believe that OK for them to make mistakes and leave their customers to deal with it themselves If this be corrected I have to cancel my account This is absolute poor customer service  
 Let my lapse due to messed up Then and put on it took it upon themselves to put my other on the Now having to pay extra fees to my other I the road Basically cause done what they wanted  
  ST The problem was a quote from these guys Anybody ever miss the days when you call up someone and a price I still understand why someone would need all my personal information to a quote The final price did not represent the quote given anyway at least not with Anyone want to steal my identity Well ask for all the info The sales agent even finish giving me the details of the policy and she was already asking me for credit card information When I had questions about the policy like why was the payment so much higher because I want to do auto draft the agent then threatened me that I already gave a   verbal authorization   to go ahead and debit my account The whole thing was a high pressure sale from start to finish ND The problem is I am in the process of through a DUI I explained this to the woman and the rate still came back higher than was quoted But not the real issue I had to SR high risk I went with because I thought they were the cheapest not try PROGRESSIVE Then I had to take the SR form down to the DMV to a hardship license so THEY REINSTATED MY LICENSE We discussed this me and the agent You think could find this information out No notification nothing Today I a bill in the mail for the past month and a cancellation notice stating payment of not reinstate the policy it is only a bill The reason for this is thinks my license is still suspended I understand the miscommunication on their part They issued and took my money while my license WAS SUSPENDED Now they've cancelled the because they think suspended when it actually is reinstated What's worse is is the co They seem to have all my other information at the touch of a computer screen like who was my first girlfriend my favorite pet and of course some childhood memories that only I would know Does it seem strange then that look up the status of my license Why should you care They really seem to know any of the ins and outs on the procedure on what to do when someone gets a DUI and the steps needed to provide the DMV with the proper documentation The only thing they DID seemed concerned with was the sale over the phone You should hear the whole script they use it walks you through the steps to the sale point by point really disgusting to hear the same formula over and over again anyone sick of calling these companies and hearing    I am sorry to hear that and I do apologize    I into the details about trying to track down the needed SR doc after I paid know this They take your money if you have any issues hand dept definitely talk to the other hand dept yesterday I received my ID cards in the mail good for the next months Today I a cancellation notice Beware you may have the same experience You want or need good coverage my experience with PROGRESSIVE has been great so far I would tell you to deal with your local company first like State Farm but they write SR I say that because when you need to verbally spank someone for the screw ups that happen too often when dealing with these companies you at least do it in person My experience with has been trash from start to finish I would recommend them to people I dislike In the future if I ever secretly hate a client of mine or anyone else I encounter that calls for a situation where forced to be nice for whatever reason I let them know what a great company is if they ever need a fast reliable streamline service with no problems and cheap rates Then I sit back and wait for that phone call about their experience And that my friends is when I smile After all I hog all the bad customer service I  
Horrible customer service fall for their low estimates with rd rate materials I took my by their service center for an estimate big mistake They quoted cheap replacement parts on their estimate and refuse to match independent estimates through my company now You have rights fall for this They are at fault in this wreck and pay to fix my properly 
 I have been with for several years I was involved in a accident on September I was sitting at a traffic light which was red and someone hit me from behind mph and pushed me into truck in front of me The truck in front of me have any damage but my was totaled The person that hit me left the scene of the accident and later was found and given a ticket this being her rd hit and run and driving with no which the state of Alabama is wrong for letting her continue to drive with no repercussions smack on the hand for the rd time I purchased policies from for non insured motorist along with my regular has treated me like I was the at fault had to hire an attorney to try to this matter resolved with no luck It has been months with no payout from They have stalled by asking for the same paperwork over & over and we have complied over & over I missed about months of work because of this accident and they have treated me like I have done something wrong or at fault has asked for all tax papers from my business docs from ambulance hospital physical therapy etc and have received these docs at least different times needs to be held accountable for this matter and pay what the policy is valued at They have taken their time by responding to the demands from my attorney months later and I still have a or compensated for this accident When purchasing these policies they were all nice and accommodating Now we them on the phone or even a response But after month if you pay your premium you be cancelled Why they take months to settle this matter & only takes month for them to drop you if you pay is very unprofessional and unconcerned about their customers Long as you pay them fine but if they have to pay you a problem I would not recommend to anyone a RIP OFF Beware of the secondary companies they are secondary for a reason They give you a good price which is always attractive but you never receive your payout when time for them to pay It should be against the law for these type company to be in business They are stealing from the consumer making promises that NOT keep BEWARE OF They never pay or you be dead when they decide to do something about it  
 I have had on and off for over years I have encouraged others to buy I called for a friend who was a minor of that was a and for the first time He was quoting other companies so I called for him to check on a better deal I he was a friend and allowed him to tell his situation and information like address and employment to the rep on my phone She us a quote and he must be to purchase I send me a quote in the email we were looking When I went to pay my bill it was higher so I called I was they added him to my policy I went over all the details and was since he was under age they added him anyway to my policy I was very angry because it was their mistake I was to go the friend's home and proof of his residence so they could take him off my policy This is crap I only called for a quote he gave his info and they thought someone was lying I suppose or have some sneaky motive to automatically add to change policies without consulting the customer I them I would not go to his house or ask his father for proof his son did not live with me this is very embarrassing Finally after I asked for a supervisor and after a wait the original lady came back on the phone no supervisor and they would take an electronic affidavit online to prove man's son lived with him and not me I am outraged that I was trying to help possible customer and was treated like a dishonest or lying person I signed the electronic paper and now looking for company This is crap service  
I missed payment due to bank error and they tripled my rate 
 Happy belated Memorial Day My Memorial Day was enjoyable but not the happy adventure I had planned for my family I had imagined to Indiana Dunes historic State Park with my daughters During the drive I had imagined teaching them about the honorable women and men that gave everything in service to protect this beautiful country Instead I woke up to a negative checking account I trusted that the system would work I called May at pm and spoke to agent Megan ** I requested to cancel the auto debit on my account I requested to have my husband removed from my auto policy I requested for a supervisor and my call was disconnected I had been a loyal customer for approximately years Since married I have had so many difficulties continuing my auto policy Approximately in November refused to take my money unless I added my husband to my policy and cut my off Remaining loyal to I followed the requested steps and continued my auto coverage with At the beginning of May I received notice that I would lose my good driver benefit and that my policy would raise to approximately I chose a path to be of service to my community by becoming a social worker for children with the State of Indiana Social Work is my passion and not the quickest way to earn a living wage for a family of four is not in my budget Once again on I requested that my husband sign an exclusion and be taken off my policy Megan ** stated that contract with the State of Indiana did not allow for such exclusions I stated that there were other auto companies in Indiana that allowed for the exclusion I stated that I had signed such an exclusion for my husband's auto policy through Titan After a lot of argument I unfortunately came to the conclusion that I could not afford to continue my relationship with and stated that if the policy could not be brought back down to there be no renewal of the policy for May I stated that since marriage has not offered the same excellent service as in the past I felt like my marriage and inability to compromise ruined the relationship I had formed with over the past several years Once again I trusted the system I trusted that Megan ** would do her job and remove the auto debit off the account I trusted that Megan ** I would not new my auto On May th I wanted to buy my children American themed swimwear glow sticks and other cheeky memorial themed toys On I was surprised that my trust was betrayed and placed into the wrong agent's hands I called at pm and spoke to Alaina ** I was very upset and use appropriate coping skills I verbally cussed and yelled Agent Alaina ** was able to calm me down and reassure me the situation would be resolved The agent canceled the policy and requested a refund to my bank account I was assured that if the recordings on proved that I requested the auto payment stopped and my policy to not renewed all my banking issues would be resolved I was to send in a running bank statement log Once again I trusted the system I prayed and thought the situation would resolve itself On I called to check on the status of my refund At pm I spoke with Sandra ** She stated that my request for to cover the overdraft fees were denied I was very upset and requested to hear the recordings from I know the recording would be key to resolving the discrepancies She once again assured me that the recordings were the key and that she was requesting to review the recording I talked about the discrepancy on when that policy cancellation date On June st at pm I was the call on had not been recorded and that would not be covering my loss at all I had requested to cover my overdraft fees I did not go running up overages on purpose I moment I realized that the payment posted to my account I stopped using my Teachers Credit Union account The last debit was for taking my children to the Drive in at Tibbs Movie Theater and purchasing hotdogs I simply lived my life expecting and trusting that agents performed their duties with integrity and honor Unfortunately that was not the case and now my account is negative I receive paycheck for days even processed a debit reversal for the My overdraft fees are for small purchases I had made on Saturday These purchases included a Beyonce CD for the drive food for the trip gas to make the trip and fast food I need assistance in returning my checking account to a positive standing My daughters are understanding that everyday people make mistakes I try to instill in my children to always correct their mistakes no matter the cost Please help me Help to correct their mistake  
 I am to start off with my most recent let down in this company I shopped around for other because I was so dissatisfied with I wanted out I found a better deal with better coverage so I called back because I thought it was only fair to see if they could match it or beat the price Well what happened next was without hesitation criminal The customer service agent continued to tell me that I had an accident on my record which I do not have and that if the other company found out it would   raise   my premiums He continued to threaten me with these lies I believe what was happening here Why would this customer service agent take this so personal I finally take it any longer and hung up Come to find out this ** canceled my policy I believe what had happened It gets better So talking to this nice lady from she because my policy was canceled I needed a new quote I   Ok whatever    My new quote was   a month   more than what I was paying hours ago It is my hope that people read this that people refuse to be threatened by these ignorant people I so wish I would have recorded the conversations and taken them to court A criminal act by a company that is suppose to protect our well being still in shock  
 My wife and I were visiting my year old mother in hospital When we came out my wife noticed the front left fender was damaged She called and was to a police report which we did We were contacted by a rude investigator who us he had been a state trooper and had a bachelor degree and he was fraud investigator I guess his mom was proud what does his bio have to do with my damage Very unprofessional He was investigating fraud He continually kept insinuating to my wife that she had run over something and deliberately underlined fraud on a paper she could see The difference in the claim payout between comprehensive and collision was Do these genius think we would damage a Cherry Z Corvette to go thru the hassle of repairs not to mention committing fraud Then he he would have the top investigator hook our to a computer and tell the day time and what hit the It is a Corvette not a There is no black box that has that info Mr Investigator We welcomed him to do so Never happened We contacted the state commissioner's office What a joke Outcome you have to agree to collision when that is the furthest from the truth Beware The gecko is really a snake in the grass Oh we were thanks for being loyal customers When do you know when the company is lying When they open their mouths I still have not deposited the check and am to the local news media to speak to their consumer protection reporter Again caution when considering

 On October my Saturn Vue XR was stolen About weeks later it was recovered and I noticed front end wheel and mirror damage Also engine light constantly on So I took it to a claims adjustor who cut me to check to have fixed at auto body of my choice But the only place that would fix my was where the claims adjustor' office was located and that was AutoNation collision of Corpus Christi Texas Other auto body places and dealership refused because they stated was too difficult to deal with and the check given me was not adequate to cover repairs So I was forced to go have my repaired at AutoNation collision Originally my was only suppose to take a day to repair but AutoNation kept it for two weeks When I picked up my it seem fine but only to find out that it and have been plagued with problem after the other When I call they refuse to help me have my properly or help me Claim adjustor supervisor consistently comes up with excuses that I have to prove that damage to my was due to it being stolen which is almost impossible since not a mechanic The only thing I was able to show was when I took it at ProDrive Alignment whom I had been to for the last years gave me a report stated my could not be alignment correctly like usually most likely to damaged it sustained when stolen Gave recommendations to what needed to be done refuses to recognize the report have my repaired properly Now my since recovered began intermittently to shimmy badly at steering wheel to the point almost all the time My did not shimmy prior to it being stolen Then the engine light came back on while on a trip and the engine died where I was forced to leave at the dealership and fly back home spend over out of my own pocket for repairs because refuses to pay and claims normal wear and tear repairs Now I drive the because it shimmies so bad and feel dangerous to drive I sell or trade the in that condition Now because of refusing to have my fixed properly due to damage from it being stolen I am at a loss and did to meet their obligations as a company Now I regret switching from Allstate to  
 withdrew money from my checking account without my permission I do not have with them I called and they me there is nothing they do about this So this is where at Any attorneys out there want to take a lawsuit against for unlawfully fraudulently withdrawing my money for a policy that mine And they suggested that I ahold of the policy owner to my money back 
 Leased a brand new from BMW with full coverage from year later my wife side swiped in a parking lot Called and they   No comp and collision Why Because I a photo inspection of brand new begrudgingly reinstated the policy but would not cover the damage Why would I need a photo inspection of a brand new is the worst company and had a lot  
 I signed on with I them I need a policy for a personal and my work It was clearly indicated in the audio that created the policy I was given a personal policy without issue for three years I established a claim on after an accident I was put under investigation for not properly indicating the actual use of the policy I spoke to Samantha a personal policy service rep who indicated she knew about my job but was I needed to establish a commercial policy as they I did not establish my work purpose with I spoke to Miss Tabitha ** a claims adjuster who investigated me who claimed my policy was falsely obtained and I needed to a commercial policy I asked Nathan a personal policy rep about a commercial policy commercial policy department indicated I do not qualify for a commercial policy I relayed this information to Tabitha ** and to her supervisor Sally ** I was then my policy would remain under investigation until a decision was made My accident claim was actually handled by myself and outside parties did not have any hand in seeing the accident tended to I have made it clear to I was willing to adjust my policy and even a commercial policy if I qualified had not responded to anything else as the accident claim unfolded I have asked to my audio responses for the initial policy's development where after three years says they do not have it nor would they offer it with the other audio I have with them In my opinion it should be a matter of including all audio or none for dispute purposes I simply am at a point to make others aware of their deceptive purposes and their lack of any empathy in the aftermath of the accident for myself or my passenger in the This company was attempting to me into a commercial policy I did not qualify for by its own policy department They also did not find an intermediate solution nor was it attempted I have filed with the BBB and explained my situation As knew about my work and personal use of my I claim negligence of the company for filing it incorrectly not producing the audio material to indicate this as well and general lack of concern for how they approach this claim and investigation  
I had a malfunction and it was considered an accident I did not hit anything but a part of the called the Engine Under Cover came undone Not only did I not hit anyone but had my son with me I was informed to view my claim online before calling for any information That was a bad thing to do I could never the Claims link to work I call and a very rude lady tells me to go back online and view claim online before calling This game happened times Dropped and money back as well The Customer Service is below poor and it is all about Hope this helps anyone considering for 
 I had accident April th Due to the accident I had damaged my back and neck then continued to treatment almost seven months All of sudden company stopped all my treatment When I called them the reply was my budget is over I hired a lawyer till now no evidence of my case I had full While I was through the treatment I lost my job I am in a bad situation because of the I am lots of medical bills rejected the medical bills This big time cheating  
 Insurance companies are there to cover in case of an accident Yet if you an accident with they raise your rates My minor accident raised my rates a year for three years I could have paid out of pocket without and been better off Definitely finding a new company I heard Liberty do this to their customers Definitely recommend that you look elsewhere for  
 Last month I was hit from behind by a insure driver She she hit me from behind because I let her in when she had her turn signal on There is no doubt she hit me on purpose because she was laughing about it I made my statement to their claims agent and them when it happened When their person made her statement she failed to tell them that she she hit me because she had her left turn signal on and I make room for her to in and she almost sideswiped me so she pulled behind me and hit me She failed to tell him that It was a low impact Collision but it was enough to me a new rear bumper The joke caused me a lot of pain and I was treated at my local VA Outpatient Clinic in the DeBakey Hospital in Houston My claims adjuster spoke to me like I was a fraud and a gold digger a retired Master peace officer with the state of Texas and US Army Airborne veteran Honor means a lot to me This really upset me and cost me some health conditions from my blood pressure up every time I spoke to this person I had a stroke last year I talked to the adjuster and I the name of her supervisor Matthew ** and ask to a new claims adjuster because of how much that lady upsets me He refused to help me out I asked him for the name of his supervisor He refused saying he was taking care of it He refuted everything I and downplayed everything to make me look like a simpleton in the conversation very aware of how people talk and act I was a detective in the third largest shares part of the nation Despite how upset I was he refused to help me at all and a new adjuster I am very upset So upset shaking but I have not lost my composure or dignity in the conversation All the commercial that says they support and take care of their veterans no they do not The adjuster and the supervisor Matthew are condescending arrogant and pompous dealt with a few good people in this company including the man who looked at the damage of my truck but people like the adjuster and her supervisor make it to the point where I never want to deal with this company ever again The supervisor they normally do not change out adjusters on a case like this I him it could be done He yes but he would not They limited my ability to file a complaint to a higher supervisor that may be able to placate the situation  
 I have had a few problems with this company since I have been with them First I did a claim for a tow truck and was they would come to my house take off my tire and take me up to a tire shop to a new then take me back home to put the tire on When the tow truck came they informed me that they do not do that but they tow me which was fine I checked with and was informed I was covered The company they used was very rude the guy was unfriendly and did not make me feel comfortable My second problem with was I called to postpone a payment due to when my check would post to my account and they refused to help with that or waive the late fee I have only done this time and most company who care about their customers work with you Now to my third major complaint I was in a hit and run accident and had to file a claim on my policy I was informed that I have a deductible I have to pay before I my back from the dealership I be taking my to When you are trying to make ends meet and only have very hard They were unwilling to work with me and I was that I did not uninsured motor coverage I never rejected anything I was never even offered that I assumed when I set up my policy and had rental cover and other coverages to cover if something was to happen was included Apparently not and I would not recommend to anyone that I know or anyone that may ask me about a company  
 Someone vandalized my and I called I took the a body repair and they it cost me over but when the adjuster came he the worth of the damage done to my was and that is not even up to my deductible And they further added to my premium even though they did not do anything to my claim They kept increasing my premium every months without any significant reason The company is full of trained professional con artist They have the worst service very rigid policy and they do not care about their customer They are very greedy and shady they lack integrity I never recommend this company to anyone I never use this shady greedy company again in my life They are con professionals and very disrespectful  
 I was contacted by an adjuster within hours of the accident while I was still in the ER and offered to have my medical bills paid and given I declined Since then lost my job had surgeries physical therapy and my life is ruined These people know their guy was intoxicated and hit my school bus while I was stopped picking up children Still knowing their guy was intoxicated and hit a stopped bus narrowly missing a child by seconds on camera they not settle anything other than a joke I be in pain for the rest of my life Even if they paid out the max which is it would never cover the damage that has happened to me and my life These people are disgusting human beings and I know how they live with themselves If you have them drop them If you hit by them kiss your life goodbye  
 I have been with for years I called to a quote for my oldest daughter who is away in college owns her own and already has her own I made it very clear I needed a quote and before off the phone I asked how long the quote would be good for days later I received a bill for hundreds of dollars due in weeks on my already paid account with no explanation I called to find out what's on they they went ahead and added her to my account The only way to remove her would be to jump through many hoops and send them proof of my daughter's current situation housing I feel that it is legal to add a grown woman living on her own driving her own with her own to my account without telling me or my permission I cancelled my through them And let them know that no in my family of be through them  
 I've wasted hours dealing with obfuscation and shifting excuses from for not authorizing me to rent a while mine was in the shop a Kafka esque nightmare of dealing with a different person each time a call with a different explanation of their policies from each one My own company immediately concluded that the accident was the fault of the negligent customer who rear ended my waived deductible appraised the damage and paid the body shop in less than a week But for renting a while mine is in the shop for three weeks I have had to turn to since it was their policyholder's fault and I carry   substitute transportation   on my own policy Unfortunately their own policyholder had not reported the accident to them So they they had to   offer a courtesy period of days to wait for a report   before authorizing me to rent a I took a financial risk and rented a anyway confident that they would quickly agree it was the other party's fault When I called at days I was they had to wait days as a   courtesy   to their driver Today I called at the day point and was that they still hadn't heard from the other driver And despite the photographic evidence I provided of the collision both at the site and photos of the their driver's registration and license I was now that it enough judge fault and to authorize the rental and that they had to wait days before pursuing the   investigation   further with the non cooperating driver I asked what happens if the driver had repaired her own front bumper by then and despite my photo evidence denied being there and they had no satisfactory answer If they had me the whole story upfront about their policies and procedures I have wasted all this time with them They clearly keep their costs down by finding any excuse to avoid paying out I only wish good luck to my own company with the subrogation process of passing the collision repair cost on to to have to eat the rental cost and be grateful for my own coverage Any thought of switching to for slightly lower rates is banished from my mind forever after this experience Fortunately no in Massachusetts is at fault for being rear ended By the way I was crawling slowly and properly in a traffic jam for many minutes when that driver simply powered into my apparently looking backward to see if she could change lanes The photographs I uploaded to are undeniable evidence of fault and of the driver's identity And I had three witnesses in my but that count either in their book because their own driver still had not responded to their phone calls or reported the accident  
 My husband and I were rear ended on a freeway in Los Angeles by an uninsured motorist We carried full coverage with therefore thought we were in good hands I had had gall bladder surgery the week before this accident so I was troubled I might have damaged myself Immediately after the collision we called to report the accident On our way to an urgent care center I called to report the accident The representative was not concerned about our well being or interested in guiding us through this dilemma but instead PRESSURED ME ON THE PHONE TO SETTLE THE CASE ON THE SPOT FOR each We were shocked as we hadn't even been seen by medical doctors and although not bleeding we could feel our bodies traumatized from the collision We had to hire a law firm to represent us against after they continued to pressure us to settle been two years of back pain and the case is still not completely over The first attorney was as untrustworthy as so we lost years in the process that has a statute of limitation of yrs Long story short has good COMMERCIALS BUT HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE BEWARE  
 I'm so glad that is NOT my auto company I thought I would never have to deal with this notorious company until recently I was rear ended by a truck The truck rear ended me and pushed my to read end the in front of me My company Allstate started investigation as soon as they received the police report But the company of the in front of me waited until a month and a half later to start the investigation and concluded that my impacted their customer's twice that is impact was from me alone and the second was from the truck's rear ending me I asked the adjuster how she had reached this conclusion She it was based on what her customer I asked if there was any evidence to support this version of the story She there any except that her customer so and the truck driver the same This sounded very suspicious to me because I had learned from my adjuster at Allstate that the truck driver something totally different Eventually she was forced to admit that she something incorrect I was shocked by the way did the investigation if it be called   investigation   at all I also found the adjuster I spoke with extremely unethical as she could state something obviously untrue with so much ease So I believe that it is my moral obligation to share this experience and tell everyone to   STAY AWAY FROM    is not only slow unprofessional but also dishonest  
 April th I was on my way to work It was a weekday morning and the traffic was crazy We all stopped in the signal for the light to be green All of a sudden this hit my SUV at the back bumper but instead of being sorry he started yelling at me blaming me that I reversed and hit his At that moment it seemed funny to me because no reverse to ongoing traffic I thought he found a silly reason to cover his fault and no believe that But I so surprised when I found that had actually believed his false statement and denied my claim Unfortunately the other party and I both had so it was easy for them to believe his lie and not pay for my damage I make any witness cause I wanna bother people who has to reach their destination on time as well I thought since the other party is insured with they make a fair judgement and solve this issue But I am totally disappointed at this time I realized that their customer service has dropped really below The agent who helped me had a cheap attitude and was not helpful at all I am with for more than eight years but now I am thinking to switch my both and house elsewhere Shame on  
 This company is horrible to deal with an Allstate customer and was hit by a pill junkie All they want to do is play games give you the least amount possible even when estimates are much higher funny when you mention attorney they to jumping Still they are horrible  
 I was with for almost years no accidents or tickets Last year I am backing out of a parking space a lady comes around the corner at a high rate of speed and hits my says my fault and jacks up my rates % they also placed an 'at fault' accident report on my file so anyone else I try to insure with charges me excessive rates I have spoken with other companies and they tell me that flat out screwed me over Stay AWAY from this company they screw you over the first chance they get Trust me if you been screwed by them yet you will  
 I was rear ended by a customer two and a half months ago and dealing with them has been an absolute nightmare Their insured driver have enough property damage coverage to cover my repairs which at the time they informed me of this were estimated at What kind of policies are they giving their drivers that even cover worth of damage to someone else's property The repairs ended up totaling about K and took two weeks longer than my own rental coverage allowed because the collision shop kept finding hidden damage My had a clean record and less than miles on it at the time of the accident so any and all damage to the was related to this accident It took three increasingly angry phone calls and asking to speak to a supervisor to them to agree to reimburse me for the overages for the rental that I was only driving because their driver hit me They kept telling me prior to this that they authorize any more charges because my repairs had exceeded their insured drivers' coverage limits the coverage that they themselves gave their driver The fact that they underinsure their drivers and then try to use that as a justification not to pay out what they rightfully should is in my opinion sleazy and deceitful  
 I have been a customer with for about years for my policy I paid all my bills on time and never filed any claims – basically a perfect customer I recently submitted driver on my policy the only interaction had with and when I called them two days after their   deadline   for paperwork I   Please take the driver off I never meant to add him since it turns out he not be driving the    Because of this they that as of a month from now they refuse to renew my policy Are you kidding me They refused to budge I gladly go with someone else Absolutely horrible customer service and I kicked off a policy for doing nothing wrong  
 I am a successful business owner and I have been a customer for several years I insured my and motorcycles Their related company Liberty Mutual insured my home Over years no claims of any kind and no tickets About months ago my pre med school son did a dumb thing and a DUI He has not driven a since He is an excellent student and learned his lesson He a great job working in a lab and needs transportation I called to ask if they would provide an SR The rep they would be happy to do so provided a quote on the and we'd have the paperwork in to days The next day I received a call from an underwriter They informed me that not only would my son not receive the SR but they had canceled my policies They informed me that they would only be willing to reinstate my policies if I signed a document that stated my son would never drive of our and that would be fully indemnified if he did Horrible way to treat an excellent customer never insure with again and I continue to share this story  
 After nine and a half years of being a loyal customer with no claims and impeccable driving record for the first time I experienced a nightmare with the worst company I have ever dealt with Everything legally that is your right their response is   You did not ask for it    Classic example of that is   uninsured deductible waiver   and not sending your policy unless you call and ask for it I am if insured has full coverage as I did then uninsured deductible waiver is available but   you have to ask for it    For the first time I put in a claim for being hit by a drive in a parking lot who apparently did not have and fled the scene refused to pay the deductible portion of the damages claiming I did not ask for   uninsured deductible waiver    I checked around other companies including Automobile Club of Southern California for which I have written documentation that such deductible waiver is standard automatic and no need to ask for it Anyway to make a long story short they do everything possible to manipulate trick and pressure the insured not to pay when time comes for a claim The auto body shop I dealt with and having read the review on this website confirms the same My recommendation is do not deal with this unethical company who is only interested in taking your money but not wanting to pay you for a claim that is your legal right  
 I was with for over years During those years had made several payment arrangements with through my difficult financial times It until recently that I had incidents with automobile accidents that was not my fault I myself have not had any accidents which the fault lies with me On March I spoke with a representative and informed her I would like to make partial payment She informed me this would be fine and to ignore the cancellation notice This was not unusual for me to hear or do since I have done this several times in the past with On April th I received email stating my policy was terminated I immediately called and spoke with a representative and she informed me I needed to pay the balance of today and I did She later came back on the phone and informed me that could not reinstate me because of non faults I was left with trying to insurer to cover me and then I was penalized for overlap of seven days This is unfair for several reasons I have had coverage with for over years and when I have to use the coverage through no fault of my own I punished I spoke with a reps several times over the weekend and not time did they mention my policy has termed They discussed the accident of a hit and run accident took payment from me knowing they to reinsure me knowing I had to a coverage or I would have broken the law because I drove to work I cannot afford the penalty nor I afford the penalty other insurances are placing on my account for overlap I did not overlap I was in a financial crunch accepted partial payment and termed me and then want to thank me for my year coverage I cannot afford the penalty and pay this high cost coverage because anyone's miscommunication or understanding If you want to prove that you appreciate me being a customer for years prove it When I need your help Help  
 When I was purchasing a I selected the due to the amount I would have to pay for I confirmed two speeding violations with my sales rep He guaranteed my rate was set My rate has changed times in the last months all increasing They recorded my VIN wrong so my was not covered for these months They refused to credit me the I had paid for the premium   Save % or more   is a joke go with this company  
 Called customer care to for new from dealer They took the credit card information for payment of for first month then they found violence on my record so they went up to from for six months Violence was speeding or less mph So I asked them if I for temporary and they rejected me at all and   Sorry we help you    So I   ok give me for six months    Rep   we issue no more you from local company   since I asked for temporary It was late evening and I wanted to out from dealer with new Customer rep was so rude even I was with them for more than years Next day I went to State Farm They gave me for dollars a month and it was only dollars different with speeding ticket I not go back to anymore because they freaking give a damn Please be careful guys  
 I've been with for years I hit my garage and put a dent in my I called to see how much my rates would go up if I made a claim The agent me I would have to make a report with to that information I asked times before making the report to make sure my rates increase simply by making a report even if I pay out of pocket for my damage He verified times that it would not affect my rates Today when I called back to check on lowering my rates the agent me the report alone would increase my rates regardless of if I make a claim or pay out of pocket for the damage Using my would cost more than paying the total of damage because they were to raise my rates anyways Mind you I have a clean record other than hitting my own garage door when pulling in switching companies and I would recommend using a different company  
 On early morning of Monday April my area was flooded as a result of severe weather condition I was hit by massive flooding here in Greens Point of Houston I called on same day filed a claim on my flooded Toyota Camry I have a comprehensive policy with this company on Camry and liability on Honda have auto pay for the premiums and my account has never been delinquent After filing claims with I was informed by the claims specialist that an adjuster be assigned to me and prior to showing up to the location of the loss the adjuster give me a courtesy call to let me know the date and time he be showing up at the location The next day I called the claims department to find out if an adjuster has been assigned and still being informed to be patient that be assigned According to the claims specialist   we have massive claims as a result of the flooding in Houston area we are flying adjusters from all over the nation to assist during this period please bear with us    I called from April and still been assigned one Then I called my attorney to precede a lawsuit against and informed that a lawsuit be filed on Monday April according to my attorney for delay in responding to necessary assistance needed by the company I have coverage with On Sunday morning April while I was asleep adjuster showed up to my place appraised my as a total loss however he tried to settle me below the KBB value of my Toyota Camry Then I informed the adjuster that my Camry is SE with full specifications and not LE He tried to let me know that he gave me the best value for my I informed him that I not agree to that and they be speaking to my attorney by Monday April Then the adjuster reviewed the specifications on my and came up with figure for the value of the Camry He then called the total loss to approve on the last of which I disagree with the total loss had to approve what the adjuster stated without listening to my side On that same day Sunday April had already deducted their premium for the Camry and Honda that are not operable They cancelled the policy on Tuesday April and deducted premium on April Later I spoke to of their service representatives who stated that the premium that was debited from my account be reversed back to my account In a nutshell is the most horrible company to have coverage with I expect anything good from and same way all customers are complaining about them Buyers please beware care about you during loss and never give a dime about you and your loss They have the most horrible customer relations when it comes to services they provide to their customers It worth having with your hard earned money Please think twice before you make decision to go with Once again buyers beware Thanks  
 My under ins obtained total water damage and was considered salvage This complaint is against the claims dept and not the customer service reps of who are wonderful I spoke to the claims adjuster in the beginning and was to meet me to pick up Title paperwork Never answered his calls again for over a month Customer Service me he was sick and the supervisor would call me within days No call A week later claims rep called and he would be handling claim Never returned my call Now the original rep is back and he is to meet me to pick up paperwork from my work at am at my restaurant The man shows up at right at the busiest time and I am a server and   wants to talk   I turned this over to my mother who could deal with this man as I worked and could not be available with all these phone calls We the paperwork straightened out He was e mailed waste of time to call and leave message for a meeting time and place The response was   Have you mailed it   Asked for a mailing address and has been days and still no reply Has been months and still has not been resolved Finally we an address for the claims office and where to mail the paperwork Title in Fredericksburg VA The claims website refers you to your claim adjuster Customer Service refers you to your claim adjuster Why we   YOU MAIL THAT   in the beginning and we send the check  
  has employed the most inefficient retarded imbeciles it could find and hired them as claim representatives who know nothing about customer service and they are a bunch of stupid morons empowered with handling a simple rental claim Had to contact them over ten times repeating myself and still could not a knowledgeable willing rep to through stupid thick skulls that the rental claim needed to be taken care of two weeks after the accident WORST COMPANY TO HAVE AND DEAL WITH FILING A COMPLAINT WITH STATE BOARD OF  
 I've been with for more than years They keep increasing my rates every six months I have a clean record No tickets no accidents So I happy with that And to make things worse two weeks ago a guy rear ended me at a red light and there were two stopped in front of me Right when the other party hit me is when the light turned green When I had the chance I pulled to the side so I block the road so we exchanged info and he was also insured by And now keeps giving me excuses that they a hold of the other party today the agent me that but then he says that the other party a different story like in the same conversation not sure what is trying to do not sure how he a hold of them if he already spoke to them I feel like want to pay anything They want to rip people off by making them pay with them and then not doing anything about their claims so changing companies once all this is resolved  
 I want to start by saying dealt with CS reps at the number and they have all been so helpful caring and thorough I was T boned side swiped rammed whatever you would like to call it by a insured She admitted full guilt at the scene admitted full guilt to and they accepted full liability Once they realized I was actually hurt how bad it was they are saying because I saw her coming at me I had the power to avoid the accident and I am liable I was in a school zone in front behind and to my right and yet the liable one never heard such insanity in my life been out of work for a week and a half constant migraines My go over now and supposed to be moved into my new home this weekend and barely walk let alone carry heavy objects The condescending rude entitled 's something claims adjuster who made this decision BEFORE seeing photos of the damage to my or seeing the scene of the accident me I should've braked you mean so the behind me could have rear ended me and she could've hit me square on This is the same   young man   who has pics of stacked dollar bills at a strip club on his FB yes I looked him up I believe is giving the important decision making of someone's health livelihood and impact on their future outcome to an uneducated and illogical person like this downright shocked that I was traveling under the limit due to a school zone on my way to work this woman hits me my entire world is upside down and because I called him out for not following through and calling me back this is what dealing with fight this until the very end  
 I wish I could put stars but I had to at least put I filed a claim weeks ago today They are trying to say the hail damage on my was there when I bought the I actually took pictures of my the day I bought it I sent those pictures to them Now they are in the process of trying to a hold of the dealership where I bought my I them I have already called and they have switched owners They do not have pictures of my on file but they are still making the process longer They do not call me to update me on the process I have to call every few days and I the go around that either the claims department or the agent Either way ridiculous We have been a customer for years We have and motorcycle on our policy Let's say we be looking elsewhere for new that handle our claims properly and not drag it out  
  refused to take eye witness report of speeding   a person tell if someone is speeding   and charged me % at fault in very minor fender bender no damage to my a slight dent in other They raised my premium % and originally they took out good driver discount That discount is less than month so agent admitted they are trying to recoup from paying out on the accident I am changing companies and suggest you do business with poor customer service and their mistakes cost us  
 Couple months ago I called them to renew my policy I spoke with managers and sale agents At first I them we been with them for over years Is there any way we bring down the quote and they NO And supervisor like   Is there anything I help you beside the quotes If not I hang up the phone    Then I was like   Okay Fine    And I them   That is very bad for business you know that    And they repeated   Is there anything else I help you    I went to agency They me difference is a joke for real  
 I called with a very simple request   I am buying a from someone in New York and want to drive it to Indiana where it be kept and driven my primary residence you please give me transit of some kind In order to temp tags in NY you need a NY ID   I the Guantanamo water boarding treatment It basically consisted of a rep on the phone who asked me about questions about my driving habits where I work my wife's driving habits etc etc When I called to complain I nowhere I was by the Manager that they had concerns about my coverage because I was calling on a cellphone with a KY area code never changed the area code after moving I am sure many people do this and I was in Connecticut whereas my family was in Indiana and all this raised a lot of red flags and that is why I was subjected to this interrogation Moral of the story They believe whatever info you put in that form when you buy from them and they take every chance when you call in for anything to ask you a lot of nosy questions I be switching very soon I also believe that they did this because I recently added a new teen driver on the coverage They do this to make people switch because our risk profile has now increased They have made their money from us in the last years and care if we switch since good for them if we switched Very much like health companies Living in the great USA is simply wonderful  
 Call and waste your minutes to increase your amount by % I was paying monthly to with Renters discount added Now they are changing my to with renters discount while I am changing the address which is totally unacceptable I have a accident history as well So why mins save your % on the but in fact increase your  
 I have been a policyholder since years I have never made a claim for myself my husband or son for which any of us were responsible I had a claim for a side swipe of my parked during a snowstorm was resolved with no problem and two weeks ago I was again sideswiped in a self parking lot The person who hit my left I made the claim to and the total cost was under The job should have taken a few days This claim has been a nightmare Both the claims adjuster and his supervisor who I had to involved have been totally incompetent What should have taken a few days has dragged on and on I was THREE times my was ready I made a trip across town not close to my house and not a good neighborhood only to find that either the place was closed or my was NOT ready The excuses were well ridiculous Agent he was   out of the office   or that someone else   should   have called me I was never called only as I found out later auto texted Agent is Michael ** and his supervisor is Aronn ** Both were awful I finally called in to the main office number to file a complaint which I was is not possible I asked for some compensation for all this aggravation I have paid tens of thousands of dollars in premium and not asked for much if anything back and was they were sorry but they do anything like waive the deductible or put a credit on my account Nothing So all my loyalty to means NOTHING They care if you are a good customer or not SO OUT BEWARE to Chubb write a good policy and give you good rates but they service the policy no matter HOW LONG YOU STAY WITH I feel like a fool caught like I did  
 I'm with plus years I have better full coverage My was parked in parking lot and some truck man hit my in my parking I call open a claim Within days they call me   Your is total This is amount and you have to return a rental within days    I have money for my yet How the person is gonna put down and buy a new without any money Now I have full coverage that cover my rental for days They want to even offer that They and that adjuster was rude That I like to talk to him at all  
 One of the worst customer service with claims I ever faced and I extremely suggest not to go with auto as they give you big hard time whenever you file a claim They have their own lesser estimate and they wont agree with estimate provided by body shop and supervisor of state itself doesnt even care for the claim If you need to talk to adjuster or supervisor you may have to end up your full day by calling to them and they accept the call once in a day Even if you call customer care to report this issue they wont even take it and they say that you may have to talk supervisor only and he is the who talk all crap My situation is I met with an accident and a Body shop gave estimate of k where the doesnt worth that much and better to total it But says the estimate of k and they tell a number of stories for the difference of amount I contacted a number of body shops and they are not at all ready to repair the as the first body shop is the best and they suggested for total means the same they do But never agrees for that and they tell to take check for k and make it repair yourself This was the worst company I ever see and strongly recommend not to go with it  
 I have been with for years now Never had a claim or complaint I added my brother to my and he was pondering driving for Uber to make some additional money I called to ask them if we needed to adjust our coverage to do this They us they do not support Uber and that they do not allow customers to drive for them I   Okay we not do that then   and my brother dropped the issue I then receive a letter stating at the end of our current policy we would not be eligible for renewal I called to see why They decided not to renew us because they took that as my brother was actually driving for Uber and we would need a letter for Uber with his last date of employment to be eligible for renewal I informed them he never drove for them and asked if he a letter from them stating that he never drove for them if they would consider our renewal They they would have to have a manager look over it and determine our renewal status We provided the letter and are still waiting on a response Next issue I moved to Virginia about a month ago away from my brother in Indiana I update the information my brother and I pay the same amount we usually do and think everything is peachy weeks later I a cancellation notice is we do not pay an additional I call to be that the same exact amount I have paid for the last years at the same exact time every month is now a downpayment for the new policy since I moved I have given nearly in the past days for a policy that is normally a month because they continue to threaten to drop me for this nonsense Joke's on them because dropping them like hot They are a scam and anytime you try to call and talk to them you nowhere switching to a company that actually values loyalty and has an agent I actually speak to and cares  
 WITH WE ARE NOT IN GOOD HANDS Group is the worst company They have respect toward its insured It is very difficult to contact customers services or claims department and   do not explain anything    in case you have an accident Group attracts with a policy at low cost to then increase prices as they want Do not have respect toward minorities and immigrants give a discriminatory treatment Change prices is easy for them as well cancel the policies to charge more money The worst thing is that if the customer report a claim or have an accident claims representatives prefer to accuse their customer and pay to the opposing party declaring guilty the insured from the Group to increase the without explanation Then they increase all the costs as the customer have any rights It is abuse the treatment of customer service and claims department and the discriminatory treatment they have against minority group and immigrants determined guilty without the determination of a judge and only want to finish each case in a fast and less work to charge the insured The report of the police department represent anything The legal representative of my case orally an explanation and later send a letter with other information and in the claims department have information I am was accused by agent of claims department as guilty or at fault when my case is open The only support I have is increased the policy and the other companies give me higher prices and I have to stay with them I canceled the policy and I then rose With the Group WE ARE NOT IN GOOD HANDS  
 I be canceling my policy with due to a recent claim they are refusing to pay My husband's work truck was hit from behind by of their policy holders He lost days of work and they are refusing to pay the loss of income claim that was submitted We provided everything they asked After reviewing the paperwork submitted they started deducted this and that and depreciating his work truck and came up with a figure that was around % less than what he would have made that week I have been arguing with them for weeks now The lady I spoke to they have to pay and paying was a courtesy EXCUSE ME What is for then My husband was to work was hit by their customer and lost income from it Makes no sense pretty clear cut The level of customer service is substandard the agents are rude never call back and honestly I am in shock from the level of customer service we received My opinion of has changed completely I be filing a complaint with the commissioner it together You really need some serious customer service training  
 I would like you all to know about I have been with the company for year with a policy under mine and my father's name Since having this it has been a complete nightmare The company st sent me to a person THEY recommended to inspect my They happened to throw my paperwork in the garbage and unknown to me was dropped to liability without notice which was illegal for a being financed So when someone hit my while it was parked they refused to cover the damage They had me talk to of their Reps Ayisha ** She claimed she would contact me once the investigation was done Of course months later still heard from her Now has decided to cancel our policy and refuses to reinstate or even make us a new policy because I am under my father's policy I was placed on hold times during calls They could not give me a valid reason for this  
 This company has nothing but a bunch of idiots working for them Have not had an invoice sent me since the beginning on Made credit card payment and automatically stopped sending me any invoices I did not enroll in auto payment or anything like that Every single month I a cancellation notice for nonpayment Go back in the system click off auto pay and they pull the same annoying thing over again Try to make a payment the system is down some stupid operator on the phone and she cursed left and right The phone call was recorded and it be presented on youtube for everyone to see For the whole minutes been bounced around to over operators and still the same incompetence  
 I called office today regarding a charge that the rental company charged on my credit card for I was livid how I was treated and how they handled my request I advised Care Rep Toy how I needed a supervisor I was at work and very upset That was ignored but was to the Care Rep was upset Instead when her manager on the phone and I advised her what I needed to take place ASAP I was given information on how they covered up the facts They do their part for my claim and my fault and so what My credit card was charge Is this how y'all handled customer's claims when I have text messages' times dates and who I spoken to regarding this rental company calling me every day about my claim and it was not setup right The commercial auto advised me this be taken care of last month Why did I charged anyway Now what puzzled me the most what Courtney ** taken up for care rep Toy and advised me that I belittled her appalled by such statement I would like higher management to call me ASAP If not I go to every social networks and courts for my pain and sufferings that has put me through regarding this claim Sad but I be looking for new company for my homes rentals etc I not be treated this way by no one To top it off Courtney even care want to give me any information to report her to her higher management I understand how a billion dollar company have a complaint phone number for issues like this  
 After over ten years with this company never applying for a claim I requested to have my glass repaired because of a small ding The repair shop was not available for a week They would not send someone to my residence so that week the crack larger from driving to the shop So when I to the shop it was too big and now I had to pay to have the glass repaired I believe is great taking your money but crap when they have to do a repair Avoid them  
 I was hit by a person in the backend and is trying everything they not to pay for repair First they opened a case and no problem then they closed the case and I should go to my company because they had a coverage issue with the person who hit me This should not be my problem why should I have to pay a deductible to have my company fix my I was the that hit from the back go through an intersection What a bunch of dishonorable people should been held accountable I am open a complaint with the Commissioner After that a lawyer  
  changes their price after you signed sounds familiar This time I made them promise it change and the rates are locked in Guess what happened I have had some issues in the past with raising the price after the policy started I'm sure not to be the only one but I have to warn you all about this particular case I am moving states and was looking for home and as I was currently on a regional policy Long story short I decided to go with for auto after hours discussion with Eric ** on a recorded line as their rates were lower than what the competition offered Because of my past experience with I made sure we went together through my DMV records so we have a % accurate quote We did it twice To the point that he   That be your locked in rate It cannot change    On a recorded line He called me almost every day urging me to sign up my move is still month away and at that point I was tired to shop around so I signed up days after I sign the rate goes up I call and they tell me that they found out there was a speeding ticket they see during the quote the same phrase I heard when I signed up for auto policy a while back with them I them the situation and that we spent a few hours through records I have speeding ticket and hit and run really not that hard and that they should check the recorded line Supervisor she call me back within the hour after checking the recorded line never did days later I call them back and now I a supervisor Leslie telling me   Well still the best price you'll get We have the right to change days after you sign up so yeah nothing we do if you have anything else sir bye    OK maybe she's right And legally operating But they could obviously come back tomorrow and say   Oh we found this other thing and your rate go up again    Ethically wrong in so many levels Basically they'll underquote you to rid of the competition and come up with the real price after you sign using the same phrase   We see you had that record when we did the quote    
My stolen and put a claim with weeks later I received a denial letter stating that they are not paying for my which I had full coverage They caused me a lot of intentional distress and I am planning to sue them for intentional distress and economical damages They pay your claim Be advised They treat you like criminals when you submit a claim 
 I was the victim of a hit and run the summer Being young and unhurt and thinking that my was undamaged I know enough to file a report since the other driver had fled the scene Fast forward weeks and I tried to put passengers in my back seat and thus learned that my rear axle was damaged I called to file a claim and was that since I was still a   new customer   joined a couple months before and no police report there was nothing they could do Fast forward again to late winter My mom came for a visit and at my request took my in for a routine oil change while I was at work She refused to take it to my neighborhood oil change person insisting on taking it to the dealership's service station dealership her that the required a wheel alignment but be done because the axle between the rear two wheels was too badly bent I called again accepted my fault in never filing a report and also in waiting so long but wondering what might be done The   special claims   adjuster Eric Long called me a week later and that he basically had to be convinced that I lying about the circumstances of the hit and run since it was so long ago Three weeks later Mike from called to let me know that that had   no evidence of a prior accident causing the damage to your and thus all repairs would be an out of pocket cost of K+    Already infuriated by Mr Long's initial complete rudeness I had called a competing company and switched my coverage on March th I was I could expect a pro rated refund in my bank account shortly When I noticed it still there weeks later I called again They me that my bank had   refused to accept the credit back into your account   and so had been forced to mail out a paper check on March th and would be with me shortly First of all I called my bank who in no uncertain terms assured me that there would have been absolutely no reason they would ever have refused to accept the refund back Secondly yesterday was April th and I still have my check I had to call for the rd time and demand that they re send it by overnight for which they took the overnight shipping fee out of the refund still waiting for it today All in all after being a customer of for almost years I would never recommend them to anyone And I would love to know how I could have possibly caused such damage to my axle by myself because obviously what the geckos think  
 I was State Farm insured for years and switched to because of their great rates Well they are great because they pay their claims Purchased a picked up the next evening upgraded my covered the following day Two weeks later I had a wild boar run out in front of the and that did in damage I file a claim with and right off the bat the question whether I was telling the truth about what happened months later and there is still blood on the Anyway first they believe my story then they tried to say   Well you had a hour period from the time you bought that you have full coverage    Yeah okay The accident happened two weeks later PROVE IT Uh okay bank statements showing where I stopped at a convenience store near the accident that is in a rural farm area and no where near where I live Pictures taken the very next day that are time stamped Witnesses that saw the after I bought it and after the accident They do not want to pay Not to mention we have sent pics docs and made phone calls they say they never received Then they say   Well we are to close your claim for not giving us what we need I have sent everything they have asked for    I have filed with the state a live in a claim against them I guess the next action is to seek an attorney This is so frustrating I have never dealt with an company this bad STAY AWAY IS ALL I SAY  
 Called to remove a from policy and add another Agent asked about my son and I stated that the call was only for the addition and removal of because I could not leave the lot until the new was added to my Agent stated my next payment on would be and then monthly after that End of call On was removed from my account I called and asked why the amount was so high and was they had added my son which increased the payment I did NOT add my son and I did NOT approve that amount for auto pay I was not informed of the change or the charge prior to it being removed from my account I even receive the normal text prior to the payment or I would have been able to prevent it They do nothing but try to help me find more discounts I want my money not discounts They arbitrarily made change without my knowledge This is deceptive and fraudulent but because I am on autopay I am screwed I be consulting an attorney as well as take my business elsewhere I have been a customer for years but this is unacceptable I no longer recommend  
  does not value any of their customers nor do they take into consideration of the incorrect information being provided by their service representatives In addition does not reach out to their customers nor acknowledge any inaccurate information you've received To make matters worse then debit your account without your knowledge Not to mention they continue to debit your account on the day that was not specified then when you call them to resolve the issue the representatives reply with they   cannot control the automated system   meanwhile dragging your account further into the negative I advise those who are searching for an provider to explore other vendors because this happen to you and they not make any attempts to fix the problem This company is very unprofessional and is fully controlled by greed but still play the part of how they save you money versus other carriers This is a PSA announcement  
 My I insured by since we moved in to New York For years been with and pay my bills thru online In my February bills I paid my bill online On March I log into my account so I pay my bill unfortunately I no longer go thru my account cause it I need to call due to cancelled How come my cancelled where in fact I paid last month So I called and talked to their agent and find out that my February payment did not go thru because the account was already closed So I asked what account or bank I made my payment because I know my Bank of America was years close and they me that it was Bank of America My question is why these personnel did not call or email or send letter informing me that the scheduled payment did not go thru We are driving for days with cancelled and nobody informed us crazy What are these people doing They are irresponsible incompetent and now I received a suspension order from DMV for their negligence and I need to pay a suspension order for so frustrating that you trusted that you are in good hand only to found out we are in trouble I called about the suspension order and their respond was they cannot do anything about the suspension order because I did not pay my and they cancelled it They should do something to resolved this issues but they are not that competent So devastating  
 Thank you for not renewing us Gecko It seems your lizard is a snake We have been customers for a long time We have paid on time and always liked our rates But as of today you threw us away like a piece of TRASH I hope someone reads this from your company We had no idea we would a cancellation and not even a day notice I guess throwing away long time customer is something you honor any more This company must have been bought out by China Hey LIZARD SUCK IT  
 Filed an APPEAL for Auto Claim hoping that the accident decision come in my favor On th March I was merging from Durham Ave to New Durham road When I stopped before the red light there was no in front me I started looking at the left side to find an empty pocket to merge on traffic on New Durham road that was turning right I have a that has a turning radius of feet When I was merging in an empty pocket I found that suddenly a standing in front of me & I had to apply hard breaks Collision happen because she cut me from right side from the parking lane & came in front of me Even though she came in front of my but I was first to move because of the flow of traffic on my left In spite of providing my honest statement under oath police report + collision pictures Google maps Apple maps & MapQuest Images to justify that the other person was at fault for overtaking me from right & was responsible for the damage to my of an accident decision was against me The other driver did not have any injury or damage to their instead they humiliated me with their offensive & racist remarks & behavior unfavorable decision had only added insult to an injury agree that the other person was wrong to cut me from right but as per their claims experts always the rear person at fault no matter what the situation is claims to save money for the customers by providing lower premium within min but only when you file a claim then you realize that their business tactic Even though I have appealed their decision but had an absolutely horrifying experience I have been with since last years & this was the first claim that I filed for collision with failed to understand my situation & took an unfavorable decision I am stunned dejected & disappointed with their service & be moving out ASAP Please don’t fall into their trap of lower premium within min but instead learn from my experience and try provider  
 I had been with for years Then I had my first accident Their service and response time was great I had no complaints Then a couple months later they raised my rates I decided to find company who could give me a better rate Seems like years of loyalty should have been worth more than a slap with a rate hike When it was renewal time I settled my account and moved on to a company that saves me over a year I have seen nothing except the occasional   please come back to us   ad from for two years Now all of a sudden I a notice from a collection agency saying I owe money  
Terrible exp of customers hit my Mercedes almost two months ago They did a estimate but they want to repair my Terrible customer service giving me wrong numbers when I ask to speak to the supervisor They twisted my words and manipulated me to say things so they have to pay 
  is TERRIBLE You want to know how they charge lower rates They do anything when you file a claim against them They make a few phone calls without leaving messages to their client who hit you and then say they a hold of them so your policy has to pay for it great to save a few bucks each month in but when you actually need them they do anything SUCH A JOKE  
 I had for about years when I moved to Michigan Prior to Michigan I had never had any problems However once in the state of Michigan I was treated differently My daughter was diagnosed with cancer and had three bone transplants in her driving foot and could no longer drive When this happened I called to have her taken off of and they refused They that she would have to turn her drivers license over to them or I would need to pay every month as long as she lived in my house They were VERY belligerent and more than rude Considering what we had already been through this was more thing that was below the belt I changed insurances to Progressive and have been very happy But now I a collection notice from stating that I owed them for the month I changed over This makes no sense to me especially since I had cancelled them and I changed insurances how they legally turn me over to collections to keep paying them I sent my coverage over to their legal department and they it was   Not Satisfactory   and that I still have to pay them Please someone explain to me how they legally money like this from people and not into some kind of trouble more than morally wrong it is stealing  
A driver hit me and totaled my I settled the portion of the claim without a problem I went to the doctor because of the contusions I sustained in the accident The cost of the doctor visit w X rays is The medical adjuster sent me a letter with an email address and me to submit the bill It was my choice to do this by email I thought it would be quicker to resolve has not paid the bill and it is well over a month The doctors office sent me a final notice and send the bill to a collection service if not paid in days No at has me why yet I am still trying to this information 
 I was hit by a customer and was directed to a claims facility for a estimate During the estimate I was the discrepancy of the estimate from the shop I preferred and the estimate would be worked out and I have to pay out of pocket That was not the case and now I have to pay for an accident that caused by me I guess this proves you what you pay for I would rethink the using if this is how they treat people with claims against their customers  
 Maryland Administration and State legislators must re evaluate   Unfair Methods of Competition   and   Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Patterns of Practices   applying increased surcharges to low income disabled persons Under Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts an auto company may not knowingly misrepresent material facts or relevant policy provisions in connection with a claim However maliciously done that against me in their letter dated has been penalized for   excessive inadequate or unfairly discriminatory   practices and falsified logs proven in class actions lawsuits in many states such as Illinois California Delaware New Jersey and Boston etc The State of Maryland legislators should be concern and execute legislations to ensure and prevent company misuse of these factors against their consumers a statutory of bad faith  
I was in an accident a few months back and the other party claimed I swerved into her lane and sideswiped her when in fact she had rear ended me with my only damage being above the back driver's brake light Myself and passenger against the word of the lady that rear ended me and has been trying since day to me to admit to fault and this I do not understand Why they want to pay a claim they owe Anyway I have a lawyer and have been seeing a doctor for injury pain And now is accusing me of fraud and wanting to cut off my PIP policy that is paying for my pain management I have been with them for at least years with not so much as a speeding ticket and they have been working with the other company to try and prove me at fault I have never seen such a corrupt and insane company as

 After years with I was shocked to find how I was treated after my accident this year The woman who has fault for rear ending my had State Farm and they took complete liability and care of me where was interrogating as if I hit her They also called my FIANC and asked him questions about the use of my They cancelled my policy due to his answer of me transferring product between clients therefore I do not qualify for coverage because it would be considered a commercial policy Not to mention the case worker from Amanda was condescending to me and it provoked me to give a low customer satisfaction review She called me again the same day and continually emailed me with more interrogation questions I am surprised that any company would allow the same person to reach out to them when that received a complaint No Bueno  
 I have a luxury by with full cover and they they be responsible to pay for   original   repairs After a little crack in my windshield now they the original windshield is not cover What a rape This is fraud

 My daughter was rear ended by a young driver and the impact was so severe that the entire factory installed hitch and bumper on her Ford Escape was push up under and into the frame of her Both my daughter and the young driver who had hit her in the rear had the same company       My daughter and granddaughter who was also in the at the time of the accident also sustained whiplash and suffered neck pain and headaches for up to a week after the accident My daughter had to wait on the accident report to be filed before would let her take her to have it repaired because they would not authorize the repairs until they had the young drivers policy number to submit the claim Finally after a week later adjuster met with my daughter and of their approved Ford service centers to appraised the damage My daughter was given a compatible rental to drive while the repairs were done but it smelt like a cigarette factory even when she them that the smell was intense they did not exchange the For a week the was in the shop and she finally was able to return the smelly rental and her back The repair was so awful that she now has to deal with having to deal with the Ford service department to have it fix correctly The parts that were used were not factory specifications Instead of installing the factory bumper with a factory trailer hitch assembly they installed an aftermarket trailer hitch and cut the new bumper out around the hitch to make it fit The cut bumper is jagged and with the rough edges looks like someone was in a hurry with a chainsaw After nearly decades of driving and auto repairs this is by far the worst repair job I had ever seen

 I have been insured with and on February th I paid my A few days later I a cancelled notice I immediately called and asked “Why was it cancelled ” I was my payment returned I checked my account and seen something else hit which made my payment return I put the money in and called back to pay it I was after I pay it I have to start a new policy and pay up six months in advance I asked “Why do I have to pay up months ” and was because   Y'all are frauders in Michigan You put down money You have to pay in full ”   What do you mean frauders    I ask I was   Y'all for tags and then pay    I asked   What does that have to do with me I have been insured with you for years now    I was   I'm sorry In the state of Michigan because y'all are frauders    The exact words from a manager who's direct telephone number is ** as well as a agent named Clayton that “We are sorry but Michigan is a state of frauders and this is our policy for Michigan residents ” My complaint is beware of if you live in the state of Michigan that this company is redlining and discriminating against any individual simply because they say you live in a fraud state and have made this policy against Michigan If you feel this way about Michiganders why are you even doing business in our state of you feel we are ALL FRAUDERS  
Be warned Claim service is terrible Adjuster was very slow at answering calls and e mails Only paid about of what our truck could be replaced for We spent hours sending advertisements on like for sale and they take the time to look at them horrible I not be renewing my with them in May 
 I was involved in an accident and the other driver was issued a citation My first auto accident claim ever at age first wanted to repair the for k and when I them it was only worth k they came back and that I was correct and would only pay k for the total Then they flat out lied to me repeatedly about trying to collect my losses from the other party They are worthless liars I promise you DO NOT buy your with them or you regret it should you ever have a claim  
 As the title states stay away unless you want to be treated like a criminal I have been driving for + yrs and have only had accident I was fortunate enough to have Progressive as my company who made the whole process smooth and easy I switched to and a few months later my nightmare started I woke up to find my vandalized I called the police and filed a report and then filed a claim with At first it seemed easy the people were friendly and me set up with a rental Soon my story changed into a nightmare They stopped picking up my phone calls and then assigned a   special investigator   to my case who outright accused me of trying to commit fraud He stated I bought the like that and was trying to collect money for it I send him pictures of my prior to it being vandalized time stamped pictures as well back to almost a year ago when I purchased the from my social media account to prove to him that was not the case and he calmed down and stated they would process my claim until his bipolarness kicked in a few days later when he went back to accusing me of committing fraud He too is not picking up my phone calls and currently consulting a lawyer already prepared myself mentally that it'll be a while before I paid for this but I make sure I do and that everyone knows my story and never has to go through what I am through right now They made me return my rental after a couple of days I am now left without a A company that refused to talk to me and when they do they accuse me of things that are far from the truth STAY AWAY  
 I called in to renew my auto policy in January I asked for the same and SR that I had previously and even have the recording of the conversation with their representative I paid on time and was even charged more because I changed locations A month later I a letter of suspension causing my drivers license registration and plate to all be suspended I call and they tell me suspended because I have the right kind of And this is my fault how I ended up having to pay more to have the right kind of and they refuse to reimburse me for the reinstatement fees I am now stuck with because of their error I not be renewing with after these six months They do not care about their customers and their representatives are nincompoops  
 I WAS HIT BY OF INSURED THEY FIRST OFFERED ME An adjuster by the name of R ** Then after my treatment was over she came back and then offered me which even cover the medical bills IS A JOKE They spend their money on all those fake commercials to you to sign up and then boom DO IT RECONSIDER AS YOUR COMPANY  
 I filed a claim against a policy holder submitted sufficient evidence to prove liability with a police report stating that their policy holder operated a motor in a careless or negligent manner and I had no contributing actions Alexander ** representative of claims team and his   supervisor consultant   determined that they are not at fault because their policy holder had a   conflicting story   when he admitted fault at the scene of the accident And after that insult he me that there was not very much damage to my besides   minor bumper damage   sorry but your policy holder DENTED my front quarter panel and ripped the clips off the front bumper off a Mustang that be popped back together the quarter panel has to be replaced and repainted as well as the bumper NOT TO BE CHEAP  
  Years ago I with Never had an issue except that they never mailed me the coverage info at renewal time I had informed them I had a lien holder However when I needed the coverage they I do not have any coverage for my I called and tried to the recording of the call when I the coverage They denied it to me Their rep   prove you had the coverage    I went online since they never sent the policy info My coverage info was not online That is very convenient for them is great if you never need the coverage If you think you may need coverage day stay away from this company  
 Called in to and was I had to sign up for auto draft to the best rate sure if I wanted to do auto draft so I the salesperson that I would call back He was very pushy to the point of being rude I had to cut him off and say   No thank you   as he let me off the line Called back later to talk to sales person and sign up and was that now they be able to insure both my as was used for business purposes The last pushy sales person was to sign me up but now this cannot  
 Promises promises promises all mean nothing My was struck while legally parked by a insured driver The claim for damage to my apparently has been paid however I am the run a round and ignored with a reimbursement claim for a rental I chose the cheapest Enterprise Rent a had only for days rental My calls to ignored and or not returned even though assured that the claim is being reviewed and they would contacting me within three business days In fact the person who was the original contact Darnetta ** has a message on her phone that she be on vacation December to December and to leave a message FEBRUARY I have begun telling as many people as I about the poor claim service provided to me I indicated star but only because it was required  
 I have been with those things years Never hit anyone or caused an accident Always paid my premiums months at a time I was hit for the first time They denied my claim with no real explanation They lied they were very unprofessional  
 Someone needs to look into you Michigan road downriver area adjustor and their supervisor The experience was so unprofessional The reason I am writing on here is the supervisor laughed at me on the phone and I explain   I not talk to you anymore Give me your supervisor's name and number    He stated to me   I'm it There is nobody else    When you do read this please in contact with me Someone needs to look into this your company is wonderful to work with but the reputation that these employees are giving your company they are placed in positions that they cannot handle or in speaking at a professional level Even our customer's son had to involve with this claim to handle matters  
 I have had this for years and have never had to experience their claim handling until now They are good with words of assurance but the reality is they use your premiums to buy more advertising to new subscribers They cheat their own customers I am so so disappointed with this   insurance   and feel that my loss has now become even greater as is also victimizing me PLEASE BE WARNED  
 I've had for a number of years always been very pleased with their customer service rates and on the two occasions had claims they've been fabulous Both claims were with my daughter driving her fault not Upon renewing my last policy a few months back I wanted to drop my daughter from my policy as she's now years old and living on her own She has her own place and no longer is around to drive the family They let me do that They claimed that until she had her own auto or I would be forced to pay the extra premium as if she was driving the family OK so not that big of a deal but was still costing me over every six months OUCH The real kicker came today I realized that my policy had been cancelled bought a new used in January and forgot to make the payment for the additional or so dollars the new added The cancellation bill was As soon as I realized my error I paid it online I then called to renew my policy so I would have for my The policy went for something for months to over for six months HOLY SHMOLY I to the person on the phone that was outrageous and I to pay it I off the phone calmed down as I was very angry waited about minutes then called back as I thought there must be a misunderstanding I called back and the other customer service rep confirmed the new premium I I convicted of drunk driving or killed anyone since the was cancelled four days ago I asked how they could justify nearly tripling my month premium She couldn't All she could say was how sorry she was and that if it was up to her Well I go without so I paid the % which was something to reinstate the policy but tomorrow I be calling around and with someone else as this is a screwing as far as concerned so very disappointed in as been so happy with them and had spread the work around to anyone who would listen that they were great to deal with Not anymore They've now not only lost a good customer with a perfect driving record but I no longer be singing their praises Hope it was worth it  
 Have been a loyal customer All my & family insured with In July I inquired about ride sharing as research in case I wanted to look into doing Uber or Lyft I never actually did these I wanted to learn if I could coverage if I did quote tool me that they offer in my location WA but did in other areas This inquiry on its own was enough for to completely drop my auto at my next renewal They apparently sent me some paperwork to inform me which I never got They never looked into if I actually did it asking if they offered ride sharing was enough to me banned Not only did they cancel my they informed me that I have with them forward Customer service person offer any information beyond this basically me to go to a competitor Of course I am now cancelling my homeowner's etc with them as well But BEWARE DO NOT INQUIRE ABOUT RIDESHARING IF YOU EVER WANT TO BE A CUSTOMER  
 Reported hail damage Met with adjuster adjuster there was no hail reported anywhere close to where my was until I presented videos from my phone Then she remembered that there was hail straight out lied then because I was honest and I had a claim prior to this and what was repaired from before and showed pics after work was done which were dated but find receipt They fought for a mo then denied claim and spent more money in the process waste your money with or you'll regret it  
 SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME GO WITH A LOCAL BROKER I SAVED a MONTH I had the worst experience with today I received a ridiculous quote for auto with an excellent driving record When I   no thank you    the sales rep put me on hold and came back with a quote HALF of the first quote So I   okay    and proceeded to provide my banking information including the account number and routing number to my checking account After giving the guy my banking information he put me on hold again He he was having issues with his computer and his computer was freezing and then all of a sudden he came back on the line and   I am sorry you meet our underwriting guidelines We offer you ANY policy AT ALL    AFTER taking my banking information I then called an broker that was recommended to me and better coverage in property damage versus the that was offering at a year versus the that quoted The broker looked at my driving record with me on the phone and I am a and an excellent driver and had no problem finding me a deal I still understand why I was rejected from in the first place I have had speeding ticket my whole life and no accidents SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY GO WITH A LOCAL BROKER 
Tried to make a payment on my son's account that already has my credit card on it and I a new card Payments are automatic and needed to pay because it was due yesterday and are not smart to help me the bill paid 
 I have been with for yrs No claims or accidents yet my policy increased every year I called to see if they offered any discounts since there been any claims or accidents and they no I recently called to have my towed after it slid off the road and was that they put it back on the road but tow it to my home I explained to the rep that because of the road conditions I drive home I own a rear wheel and I want to risk into an accident I pay for the towing service I should be able to use it whenever I need it She was rude and kept saying they only put my on the road and I would have to pay to have my towed to my home is full of it I not be renewing my policy with them which you have to cancel in writing or they renew it themselves I found much cheaper thru my bank with BETTER coverage  
 One of policyholders who was high at the time hit me from behind I took time off work to three quotes only to be they accept them My agent was SHOCKED at this I gave them the address of where my be so they send someone out Still do that I have to take it to them some low ball ** estimate from their retarded adjuster Now taking them to court STAY AWAY FROM AS THEY ARE THE WORST  
 My suffered flood damage so I took it to my dealership which advised me to carpet and cushions replaced refused to pay for that even though I pay every month for full coverage The claims adjuster is rude and me it was   not necessary   to my moldy cushions replaced She me I need to take it to a   water damage specialist   that's not a real thing by the way to a nd opinion and that she would provide me with a list because they cannot choose for me She sent me option ONE I took my to the place of her choosing and now they tell me that all I need is a nice shampoo and mold spray which they probably bought at Target What about the diminished value of my What about returning the damaged parts and value prior to accident like they are suppose to They are so eager to take our money but when it comes to paying out good luck with that My never be back to its original state and I never be back at  
 When my father added to his existing policy the representative created a new policy where he added the existing insured and the new one He also left the existing policy active So double charged my family for the same twice for years And now they refused the full amount that was overpaid They argued that they give us all the money back because we were not entitled for the discounted price since they should had not been two in the policy I understand that but still is unfair we paid over for the same and they only are refunding us a third of it not to mention that they kept lying to me for months when there was no working in the case No seem to care I was given the runaround Well that is ludicrous that they find excuses to keep more than half the money we overpaid them that fraudulent how they do that And we some legal advice We want OUR money back It is ridiculous that they are unwilling to fix their mistake  
 I have been cancelled on twice because of mistakes they made that they were supposed to fix and call me back after to follow through with me about and This place is a complete joke and all they could say was   I'm so sorry so sorry   instead of fixing the issues  
I was with for about years I did not have a single claim I paid on time each and every month decided to raise my monthly rate a month without a single notification They based this on the average monthly usage of California drivers and took it upon themselves to raise the amount of miles I drive per month and raised my rates Hmmm I drive the same amount of miles I did when I signed up with I guess like the free money I was giving them 
 Be very careful when quoted a policy rate as they for the most part would change it on you after agreement While at the dealership I was quoted a rate which prompted me to move forward with the lease Well after signing on the dotted line bumped the rate way up and offered no apologies Even after explaining to them that me taking the was based on both the financing company but more importantly quote After submitting a complaint I received a call from of their customer service guy who spent the entire time on the phone defending the rep instead and blaming me switching my first thing as the cm guy clearly made it seem as if a policy number to them  
 On Saturday January my daughter was the front passenger in a that was hit by a client who was drunk and driving in excess of MPH in Cincinnati Ohio My daughter's friend's was totaled in the   accident   I like referring to it as an   accident   since client chose to drink and behind the wheel impaired I am writing to inform you that NO from has made any effort to contact my daughter to check on her welfare I am LIVID at the lack of compassion displayed by Perhaps I be seeing as how client is a drunk driver I be sure to tell my friends and family about my experience or lack thereof with  
 Liberty Mutual insured driver ran red light Both were totaled We were both transported to hospital and released I sustained chest injuries from airbag deployment and was unable to work Liberty Mutual driver was given ticket My company claims adjuster Ms ** was rude seemed uninterested and refused to instruct me on how to obtain rental replacement even though I had rental coverage Outraged by her lack of empathy and unprofessionalism I contacted Liberty Mutual They took full responsibility of accident Approved rental within hour Paid for all medical bills Had check for totaled within weeks of accident Would have switched to Liberty but their premiums were too high Had been with for over years Never had claim or caused accident Left for NJM never go back Horrible company  
 Today I went to try and add my wife to my policy My company has recently let me go and tied me to a non compete in a private for profit nepotism driven environment which has left me with heavy expenses and no income gone from making k a month in the staffing business to nothing everything was happened to my   mentors   godson His sister's new husband's son it was absolutely disgusting but I put up with it because of student loans had my wages garnished the entire time which has been great to pay off my student loans however left me with no disposable income Long story short I cannot afford the additional being forced to pay to add my wife on as a driver to my policy After telling her no way we afford that continue to drive her for now she me no way that happen as a requirement of the state since she has an active driver license This is the second time been forced into a bad situation due to the laziness and incompetence of scary see how out of work forced to pay health I need we need Here's is my second series of events After a new after working my last job for a year I signed up with months into the policy I missed a payment and my policy lapsed The next month I paid what was owed and had a conversation with a rep that they would send me the binder and to make sure I sent it in or I would possibly become unregistered really think that much of it at the time maybe a traffic ticket or something either way guess what the email they sent with the   Binder   went to spam So because I went through an online portal and with all its great profitability was too lazy to follow up make sure I had it binded assigned me an agent or did anything else except my payment for the next months day while driving my employee's work laptop back to his house I was SCANNED by a State Trooper mph on the highway he allowed me in the middle lane put his lights on and pulled me over At that moment I realized what was happening to our country I this sinking feeling like Anyway he came over and let me know even though I had my was not registered and he would need to tow my So he dropped me off at a Gas station towed my later including the fee paid at the state I was back in action I cannot believe this is happening you easily see the Industry and the State working together to rob the American hard working people blind I made over K in paying my fair share of taxes only to gamed by the system that protects only the rich is part of a Communist neo fascist state meant to destroy the real workers not the ones sitting in the ivory towers like that President of for MA Last Boss or the Lobbyist that made this all happen Oh yeah Since my policy lapsed with even though I paid them every penny and more in Massachusetts you CANNOT change your company if you lapse for a YEAR been stuck with up until April when this happened last year What is wrong with America  
 We had water leak and repaired basement hardwood floors kitchen cabinets Response from is very very slow I like anymore And more over increased my monthly payments every renewal I do not recommend to my friends or family in New Jersey area  
Got hit by which also had They were unable to provide response 
 A consumer warning Do not sign the waiver of liability used by Auto Repair Xpress shops It states that the repair shop is not liable for any damage to your while it is in their shop or on their lot When I questioned the claims rep about such an outrageous clause he it was because the Auto Repair Xpress shop did not want to be responsible for any damage caused to my while the shop was working on it or while it was on their lot Apparently employees of the Auto Repair Xpress shops be trusted not to wreck my while working on it go to my dealer for repairs then sue the driver who backed into me while I was in line at a wash and write the check for the judgment I wonder if bank makes sign a waiver stating that if any of money is damaged or lost while in possession of the bank then the bank liable to for the missing funds Maybe should rethink who it chooses to designated as a Auto Xpress shop because the they sent me to was   xpressly   crossed off my list  
 While driving my auto was hit by a insured The driver accepted responsibility I contacted two days later because had not contacted me me to take my to of appraisal shops The appraiser gave me a check even though there was extensive damage to my and the appraiser did not go underneath the I did not cash the check Instead I took my to my company's appraiser of whom I used before That appraiser gave me a higher price and he it would be higher because there was likely more damage underneath called my appraiser and gave him a hard time I called and I would not tolerate their non cooperation then agreed to be the to have my fixed I used my for work refused to pay for the days I lost from working I went to the doctor refuses to pay for medical expenses and pain and suffering me to sue the insured The man who hit my I contacted the California Agency They contacted and that is how I my wages paid I sue the Insured and for the remainder  
 I was in a accident the other driver has The agent handling paying the claim Claudia ** screwed around played around with the claim took responsibility for the claim but never paid use They pay their claims In complete violation of the law and little buddy Warren and his care  
 Canceled policy without notice daughter license was suspended and they canceled the whole policy did not give choice to exclude driver my record and wife's perfect never an accident When we called back to discuss different reps us three different things It was a nightmare All other major companies would give us great rates and exclude Be very careful with this company  
 My year old was involved in a accident in which he was straight ahead on a yellow light A client was turning left on a uncontrolled intersection pulled right out in front of my son causing the accident Their client was given a ticket for failure to yield I called and filed a claim with in which they have have the police report I had to fax them a copy They even review it or the photos of the went off the word of their client and denied my claim deemed the accident my son's fault tickets matter and that put the fault on his client even though the kid paid for his ticket They they go off of a police report only of the word of their client It totaled my son's and we are out a since we only had liability on the What a bunch or shady people Would never recommend to anyone They have of the poorest ratings out there  
 In I signed a contract for auto coverage There was no fee charge to the consumer for processing your monthly payments Without any written or signed agreement from the consumer has started withdrawing fees from your account for processing payment to them Hence I now have to pay you to pay you It is a bad business policy and it is illegal without my signed consent to do so  
 I have been dealing with this company on and off for many years This seems to be a lot of talk today on television on how companies are so quick to pay claims The reality is that no company is quick to pay any claim and they always find a way to minimize their exposure at your expense is a legal way to pay for protection that you ultimately never receive is of the worst ever encountered in my years of driving secondary to Countrywide and then State Farm Be careful when dealing with We recently defended an individual after being struck by insured He needed major hip replacement There were no independent witnesses It was a comparable negligence case claims no liability in order to save their ass We took the case to court been received a judgment in excess of the policy and now the policyholder is responsible for half million dollars over the value of the policy because his company would not protect them  
 On I an online quote for auto ins On I called customer service in Lakeland FL & spoke with Brandi to verify it I gave her all additional info she needed She sent an e mail showing the same quote for a month policy I her I had to go to the bank so the funds would be available to pay the entire amount She that it was locked in When I called back the next day there would be no problem Of course when you call back you someone else Alicia she that be a problem Long story short when I called back the amount had gone up several hundred dollars There was some   problem   with the system   We'll call you back    No call after hours I called & now the rate was more than more than the original   locked in   rate No way to talk to the previous reps & this even listen Clean driving record  
 My daughter paid my auto and not minute later the person on the phone decided it was ok to take payment out of my account Hello did you not realize the credit card numbers were different Now I have to drive minutes to my bank so they see me in person to be able to my money refunded along with the overdraft fee… Would love to see this person fired for their incompetence and my gas money and my time to do their job that they should of done in the first place  
 Daughter had a wreck at an intersection insured was given a ticket for running a stop sign My daughter's was completely totaled claimed it was % my daughter's fault My daughter was not given any ticket the other driver was This is pure fraud by and I am to contact the Commissioner's office From what I hear this is on a lot Forced to retain an attorney DO NOT BUY IS A SCAMMM BE very careful dealing with their adjusters They work for Satan's money SCREW EVERYONE YOU FOR A BIG BONUS AT YEAR END  
 After being on hold and transferred over to several incompetent employees With some exceptions for hours I was FINALLY attended Unfortunately also has poorly trained mediocre employees who familiar with the policies the own company who hired them I assume the % or less you save is actually to pocket in order to keep cheap employees As I checked my email I immediately noticed from stating my policy has been canceled Naturally I assumed it was a mistake as it took me two weeks dealing with them on the phone for a previous issue where they managed to fail and update my driver's license when I moved to California from Florida Being a sane company which I thought was should use common sense knowing that if I have a current policy with both for my motorcycles and registered in California with a valid California driver license provided at the time I insured every they canceled my policy WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING So as I saw the subject of the email immediately I knew it was wrong or an old notice which I never received either How such a big company like be foolish enough to repeat the same nightmare over and over again with despicable customer service and treatment For my not so surprise they canceled my policy for the second time WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING AGAIN After hours on hold and transferring over to someone who knows how to answer the phone they stated my policy was canceled for failure to pay According to a payment of + was needed to continue my and so I paid This individual assisting me or vice versa as I explained details similar as to speaking to a child proceeded to tell me that I would be transferred yes again to a representative who would assist me with a new quote Before I was able to ask even why the phone transferred over without a   goodbye     thank you   or   thanks for being a loyal customer for the past years   Of course after min confirming my identity yet again I was able to ask what was on and why a new policy but I was dealing again with trainee on the phone who know how to answer a basic question In my frustration I requested a supervisor superior manager or whatever they call themselves The woman was somewhat patient and understanding on the phone until I assured her I refuse to pay for a new policy because what they did is simply WRONG I demanded then to continue my current expired and please fix their system to use the card for autopay as I had it setup In the midst of explaining their wrongdoing the   superior   took it to herself and straight lie manipulate and hustle me out of the situation Being outstandingly rude raising her voice to me and talking over my concerns claims to have sent me a notification by mail NOT Email about weeks ago that I never received Today I did receive my FIRST email notification stating my has been canceled It was actually canceled a week ago Questions I made myself after the upsetting and disturbing experience with them If they have all my information including SSN email physical address information CEL PHONE NUMBER why did they not reach out to me for payment If my autopay failed once why they use any other of the two credit cards they have on file which I provided last time with my previous experience BTW the   superior   did confirm she had all three credit cards on file Why are the employees so unexperienced and who is in control of quality control preventing   superiors   to disrespect the customers Are we   inferior   How hard is it for them to run a legitimate business and remember that   The customer is always right   Conclusions My OWN seems to found a crack in the system to trick scam fraud and steal from honest hardworking people who want to be insured by finding any excuse or reason to cancel your policy WITHOUT warning in order to charge a new policy fee accurate assumption would be that Agents deliberately cancel your policy in order to obligate you into a new since agents receive a % commission on the first years premium Both Journal and Huffington Post claim these numbers in a report I definitely not be insuring with ever again and I make it extremely clear to all my know relatives and friends to end s policy before they not only steal their money but take the pockets with them too This is my first consumer review complaint and hoping I was able to help some people Being a young hard working man I was able to buy my first at age when I moved to the US and immediately insuring it with years ago because I saw the lizard everywhere I looked A type of subliminal Nazi propaganda growing in my subconscious At being a business owner thanks to the opportunities America has provided and being a hard worker for both my business and my community I not stand being bullied and mocked by a large corporation like They lose business I gave them insuring my first years ago they have lost all my future business and current insured with them But most importantly they lost my respect which I demand be given and received no matter economic situation education level race culture ethnicity religion and especially they lost it once they interrupted and mocked my confused and frustrated yet polite form of speaking not only fooled me endlessly but they have robbed me of my tranquility my time with my family dealing with these issues my sleep by agitating me at am and my time writing this review stealing my sleep and rattling my mind after a hard day of work Recommendation for Change the lizard for a Snake it suits the companies principals better It prevent misleading future innocent consumers into gaining your trust  
 I was sitting in the medium on highway and a Suburban SUV smashed into my little Dodge Neon Not only smashed but stop kept pushing my She obviously was looking at the oncoming traffic to merge onto the highway and did not see me Both the other driver and myself had Before ANYONE saw my from they determined it was % each our fault The other drivers bumper was cracked and my totaled My drivers side door and rear door was hit so hard it creased even my hood The other driver I was moving in front of her However when finally sent their field adjuster a MONTH later he in front of witnesses that by inspecting my damage it was obvious I moving This accident happened December nd The office workers then decided TODAY I still would be % wrong and therefore paying % of my value Not only did they not worry about me not being paid since December nd they even listen to their field adjuster who it was obvious I moving I also had a neighbor who worked for Allstate look at my who the same thing Judging by the impact and lack of scraps I moving sure knows how to collect their fee each month but waste your money because they do what is right even with evidence I have now decided to go with Allstate with comprehensive coverage a deductible and STILL pay LESS than I was paying for basic liability from We as consumers need to share info in order to help keep companies who blatantly rip us off for NO apparent reason other than they can When looking for THIS is what you expect And a little lizard to where they spend their money instead of their customers  
 Increased premium every six months hit while in store I tapped rear of they cut in front at red light and slammed on their brakes Only scratch about inch on their old with prior bumper damage  
 is the worst auto ever Unless you like being raped They jacked up my monthly price after hit by driver It was determined the other driver's fault yet they increased my monthly rate by over When I asked why they explain and hung up They did nothing to help me after my accident and tried to lowball me on my truck's value They offered me under of my truck's value They did nothing to help me with my injuries and I had to hire an attorney This is the worst company I have ever dealt with my entire life Stay away from 
I was in an accident on October I called right away The metro came in while I was on the phone with the agent I her hold on for a second She hang up on me I called back and the agent that my plan would not cover any cost whatsoever NONE OF THEM OFFER emergency road service which was covered on my plan I have to spent to tow my The next morning of the agent call me in the morning woke me up and me they are not responsible for any damage TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE Go with other company 
 Placed a claim with days ago Waiting to receive video of the accident from the store that we were in front of before I could gather all my information The auditor   we refuse to accept responsibility    I   But you received all of my info so how did you make that determination so quickly      Just off of what we were by both parties    He never inspected the No wonder they lizard representing company BEWARE  
 I called and spoke with Patrick mgr at the Mary Esther FL office He was pleasant and gave me a quote for my daughter who was purchasing her first The next day I called to speak to him about the quote and he was not in the office so I spoke with a woman in the office who was not good in dealing with customer service There was a mix up in the coverage had my daughter down as having A few days later my daughter called back to speak with this same woman who was again quite unhelpful and very maddening to deal with This woman was not interested in clearing up any issue or helping at all So frustrating to deal with people like this My daughter and I both requested Patrick phone us back and he still has not We also gave privacy release for both mother daughter to have information about the policy We finally phoned the number reps who were awesome with their customer service skills and they were able to solve the issue  
 Do yourself a favor and elsewhere My son had the same coverage liability only They raised our rate when he changed from an SUV to a Hyundai Agent claiming the small Hyundai Accent could do more damage in an accident I feel completely ripped off My son barely make the payments as it is Every time you call them they raise the rate Awful company Do not buy their policies  
I have I tried to update their locations with but kept giving me cancellation notices due to the policy update I went for months providing documentation that they requested I had been a customer for over years I gave up after the last cancellation notice and I pay extra to in order to avoid the headache put me through 
 weeks ago I was in a accident that totaled my The claim rep was very helpful with answering all my questions My problem had to do with the damage appraiser Problems started right from the start He went and saw my at the body shop but was only able to see the exterior of my The body shop called back the adjuster for a supplement to look at the internal damage It took him a week to actually there When he finally arrived he was very rude to the body shop owner and did not want to work with him I had to find out that my was a total loss from the website I received no call letting me know that my was a total loss I left several messages on the adjuster's phone letting him know that the settlement price was not acceptable totally short changed me on the worth of my I even had my husband call and he left several messages Finally we received a phone call back from the adjuster except he cursed my husband out over the settlement We ended up accepting the settlement price because would not work with us and we had it with leaving messages The process of the settlement check began We were that we would have the check asap That did not happen person us to come and pick up the check We there with the title to my and were we the check because the adjuster had to give it to us Left again several messages and no call back We finally went to a supervisor and was the had to be picked up first to the check Plus due to a feud between the body shop and the adjuster over not picking up the the adjuster never called it in the check would be delayed even more It is now a week later The has been picked up but still no check Left several more messages and still no answer I have a day left on my rental and would like to buy a new but no check to do that I definitely be dropping when the check is finally issued and delivered VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE 
In Chicago if you have a breakdown only tow to closest dealership They decide who repairs the Any repair or destination beyond that location is your expense In general the range of tow is small You verify at ** Not a good service for Chicago customers 
 My taxi was sitting behind a row of stopped at a red light when Hispanic adults deep trunked it at mph No brakes no attempt to stop Totaled my crown Vic meanwhile her range rover sustained very little front bumper damage She was so fast the force pushed my crown Vic into the Toyota pick up in front of us and bent his bumper underneath his frame The local police let her go without testing for any impairment or citing her for failure to stop texting and driving or negligent driving instead the local sheriff followed them home After I had to have my taxi towed off site her she added the the day after denied responsibility until a week or two later and it took a month to obtain police report She knows someone in the county office because they swept it under the rug After threatening I was suing their client because they me they were not paying to convert my to a taxi they were to replace my at k Then I contacted the state commissioner and they involved Now I finally my money But I since have cancelled my personal policy with And I want to let everybody know about their unprofessionally fraudulent business practices  
 These guys are evasive with fraudulent business practices My was vandalized weeks later no payout on the claim They are trying to claim that the ey marks on my happened at different times and even sent some independent company to verify what they weeks after that independent guy came out Still nothing and the claims supervisor even call back What a joke of an company  
Terrible Look somewhere else for When we cancelled our because we found a policy elsewhere at half the price had charged they contacted our state DMV office and stated we no longer had screw up cost me and time from work to fix their mess I cannot recommend this company to anyone 
I've been dealing with a claim for three months and everybody's give me the runaround after being with them for four years And making me feel bad over my being stolen Like I did something wrong 
 In Jan I was shopping for Several companies contacts found an 'at fault accident' which they read as moving violation on an database I had a claim in wherein my significant other let my fifth wheel trailer drop onto the bed of my pickup I filed a claim There was no violation it moving I even involved A supervisor at stated that they had no other way to report it which they obviously should have onto the net My view surely an accident like this tree damage stone damage anything falling onto a even must have a reporting format that appear as seemingly a moving violation They offered to draft an explanatory letter but not remove it As I shopping  
 I have been a policy holder since I was years old Now I am years old and every year my policy goes up at least twenty dollars I changed last year and the policy went up to this twice already I did not change my address tickets or in accidents They are all thiefs and changing to ESURANCE  
 My step son and his girlfriend had an accident on Dec The driver was at fault for failure to yield to the right of way After several attempts at some sort of action which included sending them a copy of the police report x states that they conducted their own investigation and concluded that my stepson's girlfriend was speeding and would only cover % of the damages I am beyond irate The that my stepson and his girlfriend were in which was mine is totaled His girlfriend is pregnant and was injured in the crash that the driver caused Now they my step son and his girlfriend have no way of back and forth to her doctor unless my fiance or myself take them I would love to know how thinks that their findings are more credible than a police report which indicates that the driver admitted to not seeing my and that the driver failed to yield to the right of way Not on single page of the page report does it report of anyone speeding This is a blatant attempt by to dodge their responsibilities We are now looking into lawyers All we wanted was for to do the right thing provide a rental and give us fair market value for the that was destroyed by the driver  
 I have been with more than years I have two older Honda CRV and XLR cadillac I have taken a driving defense course to reduce my rates and never had an accident nor a ticket This company has increased my rates each year Recently I have made a location move within the same state and my policy has increased from months to + every months Parenthetically I am currently looking for auto company  
 My husband was injured in a pretty bad accident and was not at fault The accident was witnessed by an on duty police officer and the other driver was ticketed My husband was heading straight on a rainy day and had the right of way The other driver blew through a stop sign and attempted to turn left in front of my husband who tried to stop and could not due to rainy conditions The other driver was not the owner of the and neither he nor the owner had   good   Although we tried to file with the owner's company they refused to pay for the damages but did cover medical expenses The attorneys helping us then filed with our company The result They deposed my husband interrogated him and kicked us off our policy To make matters worse they have asked us to resubmit out original inspection papers at least times We have even hand delivered the papers and yet they continue to tell us they have them they are illegible etc Also they do not answer our calls or emails in a timely fashion I am disgusted with them been with Progressive as well and after my dad had a fender bender in my they kicked me off that policy too though I had been a loyal customer for many years In reading other companies' reviews I think they are probably all pretty dishonest disloyal and unhelpful is probably on par with all the other companies out there  
 Please beware of quotes I did all the online info and received a quote I called the agent to possibly purchase BEWARE She want your credit card to run an auto background check for last years I was quoted a rate of for the autos with down payment She comes back to the phone to ask me a question   See you had a comprehensive claim in for    I thought back and realized had damaged in a break in almost years ago She continued talking and giving info At no time did she   by the way your monthly rate up per month   based on my incident Like a SCAM no Disclosure I called her out on it She had downpayment of initially when we started and my credit card and at the end she stated quickly that down payment of be charged to my card did not even tell me the monthly charge up also What She never disclosed to me that she was changing the rate A bunch of Crooks BEWARE Leave these people alone Very dirty I checking my credit card to make sure try to charge me  
 Due to the fact I worked for Uber for a brief period terminated my auto a month and a half ago without notifying me They claim to have sent me a notice in the mail but we all know how that goes I never received such a notice Why not an email or a phone call I find out until I could no longer log into my account What truly irks me is the fact I approached them about my new employment with Uber many months ago and they claimed it was fine and that I would be covered in the event of an accident Now they've left me high and dry However there is a happy ending By through Al Boenker Agency I am looking at a prospective dollars off my monthly payments through a different auto  
 Stay away from I into a fender bender with my girlfriend's that resulted in in minor damage to the bumper I simply called customer service to ask the question   whose would cover this    I the customer service rep who was very aggressive that I was not to file a claim and was asking a question RAISED MY RATES % because I asked a question There was never a claim filed and we knew all along that I would fix the out of pocket This is HIGHWAY ROBBERY and is UNFAIR UNETHICAL IMMORAL and plain wrong My on my used went from yr to a year and I never filed a claim If this is not illegal it needs to be This is outrageous How our state Commissioner and our Congress people and law allow such a thing This is nothing short of robbery This is American business GREED and Consumers ought to be protected from this This is an outrage  
 For the lowest rates I had my daughter and son in law contact They wrote a policy with and have a minor comp claim expects their customers to drive miles in order for a adjuster to make up an estimate It looks like of the reasons their rates are low is because they have enough employees to do the job right Pitiful claims service from  
 Spoken with the customer rep which was good then had to recall them again on the next day and I have gotten totally different statement along with payment after explaining to them that I had already agree with the previous customer rep and they it was noted in the system appeared they lie and inform they keep record of what was noted is a scam and not value to customers  
 After being a years loyal customer I called them to have some discount in bill if possible after spending loyal years without any accident no violation whatsoever no past due payment Well after long discussion with an agent he I might have no discount as I already paying a minimum available Until that moment I have no complain and issue After weeks from that call I have been shocked and surprised to see an increase in my bill instead of decrease without any notifying and without any specific reason while I have already paid the bill cycle in full at that time I called them again and asked them to remove that increased amount otherwise I cancel my policy They care with no respect as well and immediately punished me with a shocking cancellation Well in the end I felt so so so regret wasting my years and money with irritate company Anyway I have switched immediately to company at that time I received a call from them offering me a new policy and new program At that point they fail from my eyes ultimately and completely as I consider that as a silly and immature game Come on you wake up and grow Not all customers are casuals and victims No more mistakes  
 All good until you have a claim Husband wrecked his truck back in September pulling into his uncle's funeral He was hit from behind Trucks still in the shop by the way They refused to total it and the bill is up to now GMC New frame and new truck bed They return your calls and if they do an argument The guy who caused the accident his pay but thousand so we had to resort to ours sad Not to mention we've had to borrow a from family members recommend them at all If you do and have a claim take it to a dealership Apparently that makes them mad All these stars they have to call bs on them because I heard a good thing about them in TN  
Thank goodness I am not with this horrible company I have also filed a complaint to the commissioner in my state as well I had an accident on with a insured who was speeding in a parking lot and failed the right away and hit my Ford Explorer with his Ford Mustang totaling my Explorer My adjuster Michal refused to let me speak to her sup and advised I was partially at fault because I should have anticipated a driver speeding and not yielding in a parking lot I went through my company which is USAA and they have been great They are against for repayment Such a headache and poor customer service 
 We were loyal customers for years My daughter wanted to buy a and was on a tight budget She saw she liked but knew that she had to be able to afford full coverage So my husband called and a quote for each we looked at Finally we were given a quote that she could afford So based on that quote she purchased the When my husband called back the quote was higher than it was before We understand that a quote is a quote but a big difference My husband asked why it was such a big difference He was that when the original person gave him the quote it was for months as it always is We know this My husband had asked him how much it would be per month because my daughter needed to know how much it would be each month Now this person that that original quote for each month was a mistake They calculate the payment each month on a calculator and that guy made a mistake My husband put the on our policy because my daughter had to have However I called back and spoke with a man and stated that they gave us that original quote based on that my daughter bought this that fair should do something about it Who is to pay that extra He they do anything they adjust claims I him I asking him to adjust a claim I wanted to take care of that because my daughter take the back She's stuck with it now because of that original quote He gave me some other explanation for why the quote was now different from that original quote I him that we were that it was because of a calculator mistake and now he's changing it I asked to speak to a manager A man named Donovan called me back saying he was the manager He gave me a completely different excuse for why the wrong quote was given I him that it really even matter how the mistake was made What matters is that their mistake was now costing us extra a month and not fair that we have to pay it because of their mistake He really believe that the original guy made that mistake I asked him if they record calls If do then listen to the recording He acted as if he hadn't thought of that and like it was a good idea He they do random recordings so he would see if that conversation was recorded Then after a minute of silence he   I'm still here reading through this transcript    I thought great he found the recording After a few minutes he   O sorry That call recorded    I believe he lied If it recorded what transcript was he reading After more talking back and forth I him I want to speak to his manager He that he was the highest person I could talk to I asked him   In all of you are the only person I talk to    He yes I him that really sad to be a loyal customer to a company for so long then for the company to show you that they are not an honorable company I him that we be taking our business elsewhere He talked about their competitive pricing and asked me why we adjust the coverage on our other to make up for that I him   Why should we make adjustments for your mistake We have to adjust anything    When we finally found company I called to cancel our policy The representative that someone would call me back A lady called me back and tried to convince me to stay on with I briefly explained what happened and her we were done She   I wish you had spoken to me when all this happened the with the authority to adjust how much you pay    I her   Umm Donovan that he was the only in all of I could talk to    She   Yeah reading that here sorry about that    This confirmed to me that we screwed over We were given a quote it honored we were over and over again that because of laws they could not adjust quotes and to cover it That is absolutely disgusting Then she me several times that she could cut my rates in half if I stayed with maybe even more I her no This was a horrible experience now convinced that is a dishonorable company and do not deserve loyal customers like us  
 Do not trust and its agents I feel I have been cheated not only once but times Earlier I assumed it was human error so did not go for further complaints as it was resolved but now it seems everything is intentional st incident It was that had put false accusation of having accidents and tickets I was paying more than I should have During renewal the premium increased and I made an inquiry why the premium is increasing and they me I had violations so my premium is high I provided them my clear history from DMV and they refunded the difference I had not at fault accident Immediately after accident I called my agents and provide details of the accidents Two days later I call from agent saying I be the full amount as other party has accepted their mistake so gave me choice either file myself or file through As other party has already accepted so I want to take any hassle so I choose to go through my After days call says the other party accept liability so I the full amount I was earlier agents they cannot do anything if other party changes their mind Since they tried to cheat me earlier with false accusation so I really know who's playing game here I asked to provide the document which stated that other party had accepted their liability but they say they refuse to provide any information Whenever I talk to agent they insist to accept whatever they provide and close the case I am not accusing all the agents some of them were nice helpful and but they had no authority Make sure to record everything they promise you at first so you have proof later on when they change their statement    minutes could save you % or more on    You believe this until you have any incident later on they take your hundreds of fifteen minutes and % less amount that you deserve  
 I switched from State Farm to in Aug after being informed it does not matter which drivers in my household are assigned to which However after buying a new in Nov I was suddenly informed it does matter I had to pay for months of coverage on my new when it costs to insure it for months explanation was I was given a deal in Aug and now they are adjusting for it I filed a complaint with the state to which sent a letter of apology stating sorry for my misunderstanding There was no misunderstanding Your representative lied to me and is a bait and switch company I plan on changing companies as soon as I find a reasonable quote  
 Guys beware when you try modify or make changes on your policy through calling them on their lines I had disastrous experience explained below I had a quote for my auto policy and the same has approved From the I policy I have asked to call them back on the given numbers When I called they have me about scheduled payments and was given option to enroll autopay with checking account to avoid processing fee on every month I have enrolled on that same day by giving them and recorded my verbal agreement for deducting money on every month Then I was you be new email confirming the revision on scheduled payment But I neither received email nor any confirmation after my first month payment which is deducted automatically I the same scheduled amount and when I called them and asked they they receive any call from me to request auto payment Then I asked a very straight question then how DID you charge my account & how DID you my account details There is absolute no answer for that Then he try to bluff that I have called them and given payment details on the day of payment deducted from my account This is absolute criminal which I called them after my first call Then I asked what is the proof that I called He   sorry we have any information    Man never expected such unprofessional service from a company who is pretending as loyal to their customers  
 I file a claim had my drop of because vandalism on my from where I had it park The was there for only a day I see the damage because it was very dark there The next morning went out I seen the damage on my This was holiday weekend so I called next business day and file claim after was drop the adjuster my friend the was in an accident not vandalism That was not true so I called customer service They me send out an investigator After he came out he also the was in and accident After all the dumb ass questions I him before he back to his office I was have the policy cancelled I found a better policy for less money but more coverage call the finance company policy was cancelled I thought that was a jackass move  
 The other day I called to her name put on the auto card She is covered but wanted to drive for UBER but Uber not let her drive unless her name also appears on the card So I called to have her name put on the card They that they could not be put on the card and I explained the reason why that she was looking into driving for Uber The customer service rep to drive for uber she need commercial drivers and she transferred me to the commercial driver's division I repeated that she was looking into driving for uber and I would like a quote She tried to pressure me into buying the commercial auto but I I need a quote and information and she she could call back text or email me a quote I email it to me On February yesterday my wife called to postpone our payment until next Tuesday She was that our not be renewed because we are driving for uber Also we have to contact uber so they verify that we do not drive for them To say that I am upset is an understatement  
 My first accident at A van wanted to make a U turn in front of me % not my fault My takes my statement and after a week takes the other drivers statement and they call me telling that the other driver admitted it was his fault A week later I a letter from the other driver Viking telling me that is my fault I call right away my Shante and she tells me a total different story now making me accountable for the accident I have no words  
 Even though I found to be at fault for accident that totalled my new which I bought less than days prior pressured me to settle for less than than what I originally paid for the It was a economy bottom of the line tiny sedan basic literally did not even come with power locks and windows I bought it from a local dealer in business over years so I did not pay too much for this and it was of the lowest priced on the market yet refused to pay me any more than less than I had purchased it less than days prior to the total loss They even gave me full retail value as they could see by the inside of the when the claims examiner inspected that it still looked brand new It had miles on it not at all warranting paying me % of the % I paid days prior However when I argued my point as I had very good or as I later realized very expensive policy through they refused to talk only pacified me then although I only used day of my rental coverage which was for substantially more than day they refused to honor my rental coverage with no justification as I still had not been compensated a tactic to pressure me to settle with them for their offer which downright hurt my feelings more than anything It was such a slap in the face a widowed mother of two young boys under years old and my parents who worked so hard for everything they had put down on my to help me as they are not well and worry as I lost my husband of years and my parents wanted to help me as they want me broke down on the side of the road and they wanted to make sure I has reliable transportation for mine and their grandsons sakes took it all I after they paid the finance company even though I put cash down on the less than days before What's worse is they paid my finance company off before consulting me first as I would have showed them my finance company included in their payoff to an extended warranty totalling that they knew they would a refund for Which really left me hurting because the finance company their check from and their money for the extended warranty yet me I would have to wait an additional to weeks for my back and that was weeks after they their payoff money from So weeks after my was totalled I pressured from to accept less than I spent on my weeks prior Myself as refused to honor the rental agreement I purchased from them so that I would be stuck with no transportation and have to settle for a check from them which even pay tax and tag much less a downpayment I am stuck waiting an additional more months maybe for a reimbursement from big corporate who are not out of dime deciding to make me wait three months for my money back And with no no job and no but me to take care of two young boys under years old Thanks You rock And I prove that every single statement I have written is the absolute truth lost and incredibly sad that consumers still have to fork out mega money on legal representation in order to not completely screwed passed the point of total devastation by a company making billions to rob a struggling widowed mother of young kids  
I switched my plan to from because gave me a better online quote than others Then I signed the package online After months I figured out that they actually charging me at least % more due my HISTORY Anyways I decided to switch to my previous company I called them back and asked to stop my on the th Now they are sending me bill for extra bill for a day th with a collection notice I never use their service again Never ever let people use their service again Dictator company Terrible customer relation strategies 
 I has been insured with for years Recently my policy was cancelled due to nonpayment automatic debit did not go through When I called to restart my policy they me I would need a downpayment in addition to the payments that did not process When I asked how much the downpayment would be to restart my policy the agent me they tell me until I paid what was owed After paying almost they tell me they reinstate the policy   Sorry   I asked why they tell me before I made a payment because I was left without now having to find and pay company Seems like their practices were pretty shady if not illegal to me  
 Unfortunately I was involved in an accident with a insured by I did not have a for weeks due to repairs and had to rent using the insurer's dragged their feet for months to pay me back for the rental I only rented the for week out of the two I did not have my and they would not reimburse me for the full term of the rental days Beware they count only labor hours from the adjuster for the rental period and do not take into consideration any realistic time it takes to fix a through the process i e having available people on hand to fix the the time it takes the adjuster it goes to the shop to look at the and whether or not the parts are available the time your is brought in I had to call so many times and supply so much information to back Based on the experience of reimbursing only I would never use them for and would strongly urge anyone else against it too My recommendation is they spend less on advertising and more on paying claims in a timely manner  
 On December I was in a accident by of customers I was injured and they did take fault of the accident For some reason I have not been able to reach the adjuster I have emailed and left voicemail Still no response They claim they want to settle claims fast Sure could have fool me I really did want to a lawyer involved but look like where headed I really dislike this company Or maybe they should train their employees better  
 On December my husband hit a on back while parking due to a problem from his The other party does not live in Miami but Broward and was not present when the incident happened My husband called me and we called police The police officer made a report gave us a card with a report number and phone number to follow up He also left for the other party We called a reported what happened The representative gave us a claim number and let us to check the status online I was the policy holder and added my husband to the policy I checked the status many times and never found anything new I had electronic mailing with when renewing my policy I decided to end it and requested to mail my policy paper information when renewing it I found out in when we moved to a house and then noticed a big increase from our premium Then I decided to call to find out why The representative me it was because of the accident and they paid to the other party I asked why I never received an EOB because as a policy holder I should receive and is making payment on behalf of me I continued to tell him why never send me any update and when I checked the status online it was still the same and nothing changed He replied by saying they sent an adjuster to make an estimate of the damage of the from the other party I asked for proof like sent me receipt and EOB He then it was confidential and could not send me anything He proceed to say he could send me a letter I then no I need receipt from you that stated how much you paid because you would say the same thing information on the letter of what you were telling me over the phone That was when I realized did not pay but reported I would not mind at all if It paid because it would be fair I wrote a review on its website but never published it because it was not a positive review I then went to its Facebook page and wrote one They finally answered but not much I trusted but never thought it was a greedy company I never write review to bash any company but I was very hurt and decided to write about It is still now on my record I filed a dispute yesterday with Lexis Nexis a company that most company use to run potential buyer report when auto I was it take days to a response I write this review to help other consumers check their report and follow up with their company to make sure they really pay when they increase the premium I am sure most of the customers do not know or realize that  
 I was rear ended by a person that is covered by The person that hit me is % at fault The I was driving when I was hit was a Mustang GT Fastback excellent condition I purchased that the day I was hit The damage was rear quarter bumper trunk face gas filler I had the towed to a shop that works on classic and performs restorations because I take it to the shop of my choice and they are % responsible for the damages Well that is not so The quote from the shop was with hours of labor There is a lot involved to finding NOS parts and matching paint Well came up with as their estimate and man hours of labor was only willing to pay an hour labor to a custom shop that has a posted rate of a hour Now I am stuck having to pay out of pocket for repairs and paying out of pocket for a lawyer in attempt to recover money that is not willing to pay Would you trust a shop that is only making a hour to work on your classic Oh did I mention this is on Long Island NY of the highest taxed and property prices in the country And the Adjuster kept arguing with me over what a shop charge and then I his advisor on the phone and he also argued that any shop repair my There was nothing special about my  
 On I was hit head on by a young man who was insured by He was completely at fault in the accident It totaled my truck and has cost me well over in medical bills Which I tried to settle well below his policy limits to make it faster Since that work I hired a lawyer who is now after more than max policy and suing the insured for the remainder makes me sick that this company cares so little for their clients that they try to protect him from such a lawsuit when they could have  
 I tried to switch from Arbella to for year Immediately after the initial quote the policy came in the mail at a higher rate which they state they have the right to do in Massachusetts They review the policy periodically and make changes My daughter was rear ended at a complete stop in traffic and we were surcharged because they stated it made her a   higher risk   now because she was a new driver I was hit also in park and my   authorized   repair shop they hated dealing with At the end of repair my shop still have a check as in prior experiences the Company always sends its driver the check to sign over to the shop He only released the to me because he knew us Then the rental was paid by me even though I had rental on my policy I went to Enterprise to return the and refused payment Ok it was a busy summer day at the airport and a line out the door so I forked over my credit card and paid it I fought and after months I was refunded through the guilty driver's company Needless to say I switched back to Arbella and learned you what you pay for You save money no question but ask the right questions about their right to change your agreed quote and under what circumstances they change your policy Remember little red riding hood and the wolf in the grandmother's clothes buyer beware  
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO DRIVE HALF A I too have notified the Florida Dept of and filed a complaint As all of the other comments have stated balks at the idea of repairing a WHOLE Their preference is to repair half of a or as little as possible My repair shop reported to that as a result of an guardrail accident my Mercedes was knocked out of alignment and beginning the repair over a month later of the claim being filed caused premature wear of the tires tire in particular wore down excessively so I replaced it myself while waiting on According to the repair shop that new tire too began to wear prematurely refuses to pay for repairs to my tires The Adjusters not accept the mechanics expertise on repairs apparently wants to pay for as little as possible as opposed to safely making needed safety repairs So they are setting up for the next accident I have been on numerous conversations with Corporate who flip it back to the field adjusters The Manager of the adjusters in Treasure Coast Florida refused to answer my calls or Corporate calls they placed to him while I am on the phone He later writes he made calls to me and left voice messages How absurd What a way to dodge responsibility apparently approves of such deceitful methods I have been with them for many many years but this event and the others I see written confirm that the is sick I too be seeking other carriers with more reliable who REMEMBER what business they are in I advise others to do the same before it happens to you  
 I have been a licensed driver since the age of I am now Never had an accident except for in I was found not at fault however does not care and wants to hold me responsible for accident in over years and refuses to insure me After reading several of the reviews I thank God they answer me Buyers beware  
 My jeep was stolen and the adjuster DID everything she knew how to keep me from having a rental too long at a time She continued and discontinued my rental or times in less than days Sad thing is I paid on a policy for the rental If you have a commercial policy you may as well forget about having access to the covered items you are paid on It was like taking money from their kids college This lady was on their side % and no way was she to let you keep a rental you paid a policy on wanted me to bring my back home while the guy who stole it still had the key What and have it stolen again Who thinks like that Not someone with good sense steer clear They are the worst commercial auto company no customer service on weekends or if you have an accident or theft on weekend you wait til Monday to try and any help

 I was in an accident involving a insured driver who had ran a stop sign and t boned my offered a rental however it meant that I would have to put a deposit on the rental along with return to the city where the was when a decision was made on the accident happened hours away from home They were quick to respond about the issue However once I returned home the representative handling the case refused to follow any of the directions we had stated on the account He also refused to allow me to be the representative of the owner despite that being stated on the account along with the owner having the new representative that as well After waiting days from the day of them taking the did I finally receive a call with a quote They refused to do anything about the time without the or the injuries dealt with as a result from the accident I them not to bother contacting myself or the owner until further notice as I would be contacting a lawyer and that they would either hear back from them or myself A month has passed since that date and due to my busy work schedule I have yet to return a call They have been calling the owner about every hour trying to a hold of him and are now calling me times a day looking to settle on the once again Due to the difference of time schedules until recently I have been unable to contact them during that time frame I had left this account as an   until further notice   but now being harassed along with the owner as well  
 After having my consider a total loss I try to contact my adjustor Luke ** and left several messages with no answer I am very disappointed service advisors at the dealership that the a total loss something that I still understand After days they put a stop on the rental Not a good experience  
 I see very many reviews for people on the other end of the equation My son was in a MVA which was determined by all involved to be % the fault of the insured driver They were nice enough the first and second calls very solicitous concerned for my son's health Now months later still trying to collect the claim for totaled out Calls to claim center where I be transferred to the right person because of mysterious phone outages this has happened more than once unanswered voice mails Even so far as to have an appointment with agent to close claim Never showed never called back I live in a rural area without a local office Shop with a local agent only  
My son's repainted gift for through surgeries this year and I had a relative that happens to have full coverage run in to my sons parked They pay to fix it So I guess full coverage only applies to total strangers Do they have a clause about everything so they deny what they seem fit How dirty is that Lawyers may contact me if they want I have already filed complaint with consumer division in my state Hopefully they wont have a clause about that

THE mascot for should be a snake The worst experience I have ever had with an company was damaged They did everything in their power not to pay for the damages is over a month NOTHING was done 
 I have been a customer for over a year They take the payment out every month therefore I have never been late I also drive for a living My partner and I have clean MVR Minor ticket or years ago Personal I have not a ticket in over Years No DUI's They have actually raised my rates twice has also taken it upon themselves to change how far I drive to work For the last years I have lived miles from work At the most we drive miles to work or back and forth a year has changed that number to I do not like doing business with shady people  
 Last July I was traveling in state when I was hit by a in a blind intersection where I had the green light and green arrow The that hit me was so old the front looked like an accordion and their rear bumper fell off I held on when I saw she making any attempt to stop and had turned in the direction I was when she hit me My was a brand new Buick SUV and fully insured I am African American and from the beginning the ambulance hospital and police officer assumed that I had hit this young Hispanic woman though she admitted she hit me immediately took the side of the young woman but that once my was examined and it was found that she had hit me they would back me up back me up I was so badly injured that I drive anymore and my husband them to take me off the until further notice right after the accident Recently raised our rate by % and I was stuck in a hotel which I had to pay for for a month until I could travel again and was refused medical care in Albuquerque New Mexico where the accident occurred When I returned home took care of the chiropractor for a few months and that was it The massage therapist and medication that is extremely expensive out of my pocket and they are telling me to try my health to pay for the chiropractor has ignored my husband and me and are forcing me to seek out an attorney to rectify this situation My cost around and the repairs ran about plus The repairs were to be warranted but were not should have deemed the totaled and replaced it as we had to stop to the looked at for leaking fluids on the way home and the required more repairs My husband had our towed to the auto body place chose which was warrantied but when we home the shop that did the initial repairs refused to honor it So we had to wait until approved the repair bill again at the dealer's This no doubt need more repairs down the road and we be responsible for that not happy with and hate that this happened to me as the had a few thousand miles on it and I in this kind of constant pain left to wonder if the other driver or my passenger had died would I have been in jail because I was treated like a criminal rather than like a valued customer And it was assumed from the beginning that I was at fault refused to go after the other driver as if they were their customer not me  
 has given me the worst experience as far as every time I call the employee I speak to gives me different information about what I owe than the last one My rates increase every months with a perfect driving record and their claims service is slow and took up to two weeks to receive a vandalism claim 
 Horrible company all good until a claim and then you are the scum of the earth They fight everything refuse coverage do anything Completely worthless company  
 I had been a loyal customer with them for over years and then I made a claim with them My had been stolen It was found a month later and it was in pretty bad shape ranging from missing engine parts damage to the engine damaging the interior a crack in the windshield and dents on hood and other parts of the and more The was totaled but would make gurgIing type sound when you turned on the motor and made a burnt smell from under the hood Whoever stole my ran that thing into the ground The representative called me a liar and me the still runs calling it barely running still seems too optimistic and they give me the money for any repairs or for the parts that were damaged or missing on the basis of that I was a liar They ended up giving me for my that was now totaled I was furious For my work I to see new faces every day and since my claim with them I have asked customers and co workers if they have and if they have ever had to file a claim with them and how long they had or have been a customer with them From my survey the results are most people like if they have never filed a claim Every single person that had filed a claim with them that I asked people was absolutely disgusted with and from listening to all of their stories they all felt scammed them and I agree From my experience and from hearing all of the other people's experiences has no problem ripping off even their loyal customers such as myself before they scammed me  
 I was quoted dollars per month for my ram HD then I have been consistently pestered by them since then and to add it sultry to injury I have since found better coverage with a different company for per month I would not recommend this provider  
 After a relatively minor accident paid a mechanic thousands of dollars for of the worst repair jobs their follow up team had ever seen They also provided these checks to the mechanic without checking on his work and without my signature To this day they fixed my or admitted any wrongdoing  
They kept making my payment go up and up without explanation When I tried to have them fix it they because of my driving record and there is nothing on my record Their customer service they must hire complete idiots 
  was the absolute worst auto ever Take a look at the recent class actions lawsuits against them I faxed and emailed them also had the bank tell them on the phone what they were doing the bank statements showing their error in which they took three payments of over They only returned of the fees and then charged me twenty dollars because I had to block them from my account They were also deceiving would say anything lie straight to you while they are reading the bank statements I asked them several times during the time of trying to my money back how would they feel if this was your mother or yourself robbed out of your bank account always give a low quote so they reel you in to more money over the course of your premium Beware of Call your State to have them investigate if you feel they are finding absurd reasons why to add additional fees every month to your auto policy  
 In I was hit in the back by a uninsured motorist The driver who hit me had a suspended license and had no I suffered an acute neck injury which required extended medical treatment and pain management attorney dragged the claim out months after I completed treatment Although I only had two accidents in the past years both in the last five years lawyers treated me like I was a criminal lawyers claimed that I was trying to recover twice for the other accident I had Although I have been driving for almost years and only had two accidents both accidents in which I was hit by an uninsured motorist lawyers accused me of reporting the same damages in order to prolong settlement efforts and to undervalue my claim lawyers went as far as to suggest that I staged the entire accident During the arbitration lawyer attempted to correlate the accident with the fact that I was unemployed At the arbitration hired three arbitrators with a maximum fee of each to award me in damage I have in medical bills and suffered considerable pain and loss of life as the result of my accident I make payments each month to insure my automobile I have never committed a crime in my life and have an excellent driving record Yet lawyer had the nerve to asks my nephew during a deposition if I was trustworthy and could I be believed If you have to file a uninsured motorist claim with I suggest you inform your lawyer to bypass arbitration and file civil suit I have fired my attorneys and be filing civil action in a court of law against treated me unfairly  
They keep lying about why they keep raising their rates They are scammers I do not like them I not recommend them They charge too much How they raise their rates is illegal They do not give the discounts they promise They are a horrible company 
 A person fraudulently claimed we back into her double our rate with damage to our no police report no witnesses and never even sent out an investigator Our was a Mustang that supposedly did in damages to a Ford Expedition's front bumper front end without even scratching the paint on our plastic rear bumper Agent had to have failed an IQ test  
We through for our son We have been paying for the for years and all of a sudden the monthly payment went from to When we called to find out why we were it was because of an incident when our son backed his into his roommate's and a parking ticket That is it The customer service rep did not seem to care if we took our business somewhere else Very disappointing phone call We be looking for company This in example of how much you pay for and when you have incident they make it so you have to move on and they could care less Do not if you avoid it because they expect a perfect driving record 
 We cancelled our auto and umbrella policies because we sold the and no longer have a need for the When I called to cancel the policies I was that there were remaining balances on each policy that would be refunded back to us The auto policy credit would be refunded back directly to the account that was set up for auto pay and the credit due from the umbrella policy would be mailed to us via check I provided a new mailing address for the check to be sent to After waiting over three weeks and not receiving the refund to my account nor the check in the mail I called customer service to find out where the refunds were I was that a check for the auto policy refund was sent to the old address and the refund for the umbrella policy had not been processed yet Since the check was sent to the incorrect address and hadn't been received yet which should have been refunded directly to our bank account as I was not sent via check I asked that they cancel the check and send it to the new address the I provided when I initially called to cancel the policies They me I had to wait business days to receive the check at the correct address Since it has been more than business days and no check I called today to find out the status only to be that the check was never sent They needed business days to cancel the old check and then a new would be sent business days after that but none of this was automatically done In light of the fact that I have now had to call three times regarding this issue I asked that the refund check be overnighted to me They then me that they could do that but the cost to overnight it would come out of the refund amount ARE YOU KIDDING ME I asked to speak with a supervisor who also refused to overnight the check to me without charging me for it and after ma'am ing me to death I him that I would like him to send the refund check to the CORRECT ADDRESS and to know that we never do business with their company again He apologize   Okay    WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE In fact say that was no customer service I believe I wasted my time calling these incompetents THREE TIMES regarding the same issue and offer an option to them to make up for their incompetence and in turn they basically in not so many words me what I could do with that suggestion  
I was rear ended by a customer and still waiting for an adjuster to call me to set appt to look at my does not even have translators my company Allstate had to use their translator Never witnessed such a less caring company I was reared ended on and here it is and no word yet Luckily my is driveable Never go with

 I have been a loyal customer since until now has hidden policy information which is not shared openly with the consumer In my years with this company I only had claims which my fault My first claim was the result of a drunk driver hitting my then trying to flee thankful for writing down their tag number However run license plates and ask you to the information from the police officer My second claim consist an unlicensed driver running into my parked But to add insult to injury the driver have thankful for uninsured motorist In addition the supervisor for tried to give me an unfair diminished value amount for my I had to file a complaint with the Commissioner to a fair amount My final claim was the result of someone stealing my and totaled my Like all of the other claims I was given a rental but not the theft claim Even though I pay a premium to cover a rental I even offered one I had to talk to the adjuster he stated that the claims associate should have given me because it was covered in my policy I was instructed to call the claims associate in which I did However no rental Fast forward after days I had to contact the salvage department for to them to request the necessary paperwork from my finance company News flash does not have the correct telephone numbers for your finance company I constantly had to call and my finance company to the things in order so the check be sent out This process took weeks But the mess stop here even want to reimburse me for the cost of the police report Please note cannot electronically request police reports it takes them at least weeks to one I also never received my rental either I had to file complaint with the Commissioner I received a call from an idiot that works for and was that I was authorize to a rental for days However no me or contact me I simply her that offers strip down coverage and she say a word I also her that I cancel my policy immediately and she stated   I care    Now to everyone who has a policy with you feel the effects of overrated service increase premiums every months and horrible claims service down the road The advertisements for this company is where all your money is going FYI COMPANIES PAY TAXES  
 I spoke with Katie a supposed manager who was rude unprofessional and an emotional wreck She is a woman that is too emotional to do her job answer my questions on my policies and gave contradicting information is a shady Ponzi Scheme not an company They keep raising my premier every months even though I have not been in any accidents and my keeps older  
  advertises home but it subcontracts Homesite for its home coverage I had a leaky washing machine resulting in a flood in the basement and subsequent mold The total cost of repairs and remediation was about after my deductible and Homesite paid about Despite failing to fully insure my home the premiums are high I paid last year for coverage The adjuster failed to return my initial calls answer my emails I had to call the central office after a week to file the claim She continued to ignore any of my calls or emails and failed to follow up with requests and later with payment She intentionally misrepresented some of the receipts in order to avoid reimbursement The company adjuster me that the SERVPRO charges would be fully covered and since then SERVPRO has repeatedly sent me bills for The Homesite adjuster is unresponsive the worst company dealt with Also watch out for   depreciation   has a good reputation but by partnering with a nefarious home insurer they have damaged their own brand I am dropping my and never purchase from this company again  
 Do not support They are the worst auto provider in the industry I filed a vandalism claim and i was treated like the criminal I submitted phone records police report previous pictures of my as instructed I took my for inspection at Service King and was I could now take my to repair facility of my choice I dropped my off at Sewell Collision and was given a rental and my would be complete in days Enterprise later contacted me stating refused to pay rental and repair bills I contacted my adjuster Kathryn ** and was unsuccessful at rapid response She is very unprofessional and interrogated me like a criminal after I followed every request she asked of me DO NOT SUPPORT  
 I give this much when compared to other auto carriers they had some of the cheapest rates That being there unfortunately was an incident that occurred in December that left me less than pleased with their services Onus truly is on you to double and triple check your policy because the agent that I originally spoke to over the phone when I originally switched my policy to assured me that I was properly covered and matched to what I had with my previous carrier It may have been due to the age of my years that this somehow skipped over but collision was not included on my policy No biggie except the unimaginable occurred and my was involved in a hit and run with the other driver being at fault Police came to take the report and the was towed away with the tow truck driver advising me that my was totaled there was damage to the axle the front bumper was completely mangled and all airbags was deployed Thankfully no was seriously injured but what was already a stressful situations was made even worse once their claims representative me that although I have full comprehensive with glass collision was not part of my policy so there was nothing they could do for me This was a that did not even have miles on it and was in very good condition so imagine my shock when I was pretty much   Oh well this is on you to track down the other driver   or deal with the expenses myself They also tried to upsell me on now adding collision to my policy with no operational Also I had been paying for roadside assistance so thinking that at least I could be recouped for the towing expense from the accident scene to the collision center I was also that no this is not covered in my roadside assistance Two full days of calling and talking to several different representatives from claims customer service and underwriting the takeaway I from all that hassle was does not record conversations so they could not go back to the date I originally spoke to an agent to determine if I had specifically requested for collision not to be included also does not solicit or advise you that this is not on your policy so long as the is not financed or under years of age my was already paid off for There was only a difference had I chosen to include the collision which to me was so asinine And finally the roadside assistance fully explained as to what it truly covered Unfortunately since the driver fled the scene I was not able to any recourse from the other driver's also was unwilling to help whatsoever So for them to think after all of that I would even want to continue dealing with them is beyond crazy I learnt my lesson the hard way because it is cheaper does not mean it is better in the long run Beware because when things go wrong that is when you truly see the company's true nature  
 My was hit on December Contacted and they sent me to Enterprise for a rental which is part of my policy The branch manager Michael was horrible at Enterprise resulting in me leaving without a I relay the information to They explain to me I NOT A UNTIL MONDAY BECAUSE A HOLIDAY Monday comes no are in I a until Monday evening about pm have a plan B in case emergencies happen on or around holidays I pay monthly and this is absurd and thoughtless and extremely unprofessional

I dinged my on my mailbox I an estimate of close to I called in to check to see if my rates would raise if I filed a claim The original customer rep me the only person that would be able to tell me this is a claims agent I the claims agent that I want to file a claim but I was wondering what would happen to my rates if I did file a lower price claim They then me they could not tell me if the rates would raise Of course minutes after the call a claim was filed So rather than me probably not filing a claim filing a claim They have to pay for my to fixed and pay the dollars a day for a rental They probably raise my rates I drop them and they lose a customer That is the definition of a lose lose 
 Just received my month renewal notice from It more than doubled up over % From about to over Absolutely ridiculous I called to see if it was a mistake Nope They me that was not profitable enough in California and they had to raise their rates Are you kidding me It looks like I am being punished for their lousy business practice Time to call Flo  
 I paid for a months coverage with Auto A couple of months later I receive emails about having to make a payment I call to check what the charge was because I paid for months They explain and they would follow up But of course they never did I email with a pending charge and I call back again So this time they there was a ticket under my and that the charge was for the ticket I never a ticket and I tried explaining that and asked information about the ticket They give me any information I check with DMV and nothing there Called back and they give me any information no ticket # no issue # no record information Also each representative and supervisor gave me different information So they moved my policy date to more than a month behind because I pay for a ticket falsified I wanted it to be all over so I provided them with my clean record two days after I spoke to a supervisor called Sierra ** and Chris who that the policy would be as I signed up once they received my DMV proof Of course it was a way of extra money for because they never changed anything after I provided them with the information pretty much stole my money It was a mistake signing up with from the very beginning It never happen again

 What a joke insured ran a red traffic light admitted it along with witnesses and T Bones my daughter's BMW and was cited by officer for failure to stop In Bellingham WA After interviewing my daughter they decided to tell her that she was % at fault and should have stopped and looked both ways before crossing green light I guess the % discount they give their customers have to come from some place Worst company I ever dealt with I decided to run the repairs thru our company and file the law suit I had heard that claim department was a joke now I know it See you guys in court after my daughter's injuries heal  
  is the worst company in the world I swore I written this review when I had them cancelled and now I am so glad to do it and warn other people of how bad they are and indifferent to the customer Someone broke the sideview mirror on my and made a dent while my was parked at the local train station I reported this to and they     worry we take care of it    They kept giving me estimates and offers for a lot less than what the reasonable cost was of the demar is When I company several times they they take care of it and send appraiser They never did They kept giving me all kinds of excuses and went in circles till I finally gave up and quit talking to them It is unbelievable the game they played until you so sick of it I even them   Let's fix the at of your own centers to make things easier and simpler    No they handle that either Unbelievable In the end they send me a check for % of what it cost me to fix my Very rude I have dealt couple of times with other well known companies before this and the experience was very smooth and professional Stay away from trust me you regret it They are horrible horrible  
 Oct th rear ended while I was waiting on the stop light Opened the claim claim number ** Waited for about a week for a response Called to check the status of the claim Megan ** representative who handled the claim informed that coverage is denied and claim is closed on the basis that they cannot hold of the other policy holder which incidentally also had Pictures from the scene picture of policy driver license driver holding policy damage on my other persons license plate of the were disregarded as not enough evidence I requested manager to call me first request was ignored After second request and after I called her at least times manager Mallory ** decided to return the call She kindly offered to use my policy to cover the damage which I kindly denied Then she explained that damages not to be covered for the reasons already described above Argument seems ridiculous like my problem that their client refuses to respond Even if the case which is highly doubtful responsibility to have means to reach their client Later I found that uses this method not the first time of my friends had identical situation For those who think that is still worth the trouble please think again Even if you initially save % if you into accident they use any means to deny the coverage The actual cost of coverage should be calculated as time wasted arguing + amount you'll spend fixing your + monthly premium which arguably more expensive than the most expensive you find out there Would not recommend to anyone  
 I love it Always there when I need it and the customer service is also excellent time I wanted to buy a special service and with no additional cost and option they signed and I always save money with them  
My experience with was awful because they did not send me a notification that my payment was not made thru before I moved to other town They were not willing to work it out with me and not give me the refund or let me to be reissued They forced me to pay higher than before 
 When I tried to remove my adult daughter from my policy I was I had to prove she no longer lived with me so I had her fax her rental contract to showing she lived in city then I was that she had to show proof of her own but I kept explaining she own a so why would she have They insisted the only way to take her off the plan was to sign an exclusion that she would not be covered at all if she ever drove either my husband's or my It was so frustrating I decided to look at other companies and immediately a quote for better coverage with a savings from what I was paying at I NEVER use again  
 I was rear ended in Hunt County TX by someone who was insured by and they refuse to be right Their client was cited for failure to control speed admitted he left the scene and failed to call the police and has two different stories as to why he left the scene My was totaled and they are only offering They say because no witnesses then they are treating it as a fault accident because he claimed I brake checked him This company is a joke and should be investigated immediately  
 My ex wife lives in California and I live in Alabama my ex wife was using my home address in Alabama to auto for California because Alabama auto rates are considerably lower I called explaining to them that my ex wife is committing fraud using my home address in AL to auto through them for California and they that they would investigate and to the bottom of it I gave them the benefit of the doubt and after numerous phone calls to and almost close to a year now they still have not resolved the problem my ex wife still lives in California and is still insured through using my Alabama home address been almost a year now since I reported this situation They care about allowing fraud to continue as long as they are still making money this company has poor customer service and no integrity Also I recently added onto my policy and they decided to charge me the entire months in lump sum which was close to without my authorization which I cannot afford to do due to other bills I have to attend to on a monthly basis in the military and believe it or not we do not make enough to drop in a month They that they cannot reverse this because it has been processed they were very nonchalant about it ** I have been doing month to month payments and auto pay with them for almost a year now since I opened an account through them and all of a sudden they think to make a lump sum payment like that They are crooks and I highly do not recommend them at all want to also say that not a big fan about writing reviews so for me to write takes a lot This experience has been a very frustrating to say the least  
 My unoccupied parked was hit by a policyholder in June Within month they determined that the was a total loss sent me a check postage due for what they determined was its value canceled my title and registration and posted on their website that a settlement had been reached Trouble is they did all of this without talking to me the owner They have yet to provide me any justification for their interpretation value of the I hired an independent appraiser that determined my was worth more than twice estimate I sent my appraiser's report to two months ago and still no action Since has cancelled my title and registration my is now basically worthless even if I were to repair it at my expense I feel that owes me a replacement RETAIL value plus appraiser's fees taxes licenses and legal fees  
 On the morning of August th while working my night shift as an EMT I was sent on a call for a crash on the highway The crash involved a that was struck from behind by a tractor trailer truck as the traffic was at a stop causing the to be wedged underneath the back of tractor trailer that was stopped Inside that where occupants Unfortunately the driver was killed the passenger was trapped inside It took the fire dept minutes to her out Come to find out without us knowing she was pregnant luckily both mom and baby survived Later that day after I went home and went to sleep After I woke up my phone rang and it was my daughter calling from work to say that she received a phone call from a woman that my daughter that my wife was involved in an accident on the highway with a tractor trailer truck and that fire dept had to cut my wife out of the Also note my wife also had my year old grandson with her Both turned out to be o k I am writing this because not only was that a stressful day but then raised our rates Please note that my wife and I have had for over years and never made a claim other than for a broken windshield We contacted and were that as a result of the crash they had to payout approx thousand dollars total I think that if you add up how much we paid to over the years well over thousand dollars I thought this is why you have I think this was a pretty poor way to treat a longtime customer  
 Firstly overpriced simple to prove shop around Secondly I had an event where I parked in a dirt lot in a national park and when I returned to the the tires had sank enough for a rock to hang the front bumper when I backed up and it broke a clip holding the bumper costing to fix I called and the belligerent woman I spoke to I was trying to hide an accident and made a report subsequently adding points and costing me mo extra even though never paid out Thirdly my wife's was hit on the side in a parking lot with video surveillance and the other driver's declared no fault but care to pursue the video evidence so again our fault and our rates go up Waits to speak to reps are usually over minutes and they transfer you around a lot saying each different question is type of rep's responsibility but you never straight answers  
 I cancelled my policy with and approximately month later noticed they had debited my bank account without my authorization I had replaced the policy with Progressive to coincide with the cancellation of the policy When I informed that I had not renewed or initiated a new policy I was they would not cancel the policy until I either provided current documents or proof the previously insured with had been sold I sent proof of from Progressive and now waiting on a reply I have to go through this process since I cancelled the original policy with and request a new policy How create policies without authorization  
 Very good at taking your money Hard to reach real people They want you to do everything by computer When I finally reached a real person they answer my questions They decided my year old and pound chihuahua was a vicious dog even though she has never bitten anyone I never use for any reason again and never recommend them to anyone  
 After filing a claim for an accident gave me the run around First they wanted to make a decision without having all of the necessary information Secondly they frequently me they need to talk to my dad even though I am and was handling it on my own Also even after I them that the other party claimed full responsibility for the accident the manager stated that it must have been a mistake and I should be responsible Really Not helpful at all  
 I had a transmission fail had to switch to public transportation and cancel my Months later and ONLY after I switched companies when I a new did send me to collections for what they claim is I owe them I word and they immediately sent it to a collection agency thus dinging my credit I HATE this company work for a fortune company in the auto business and spread the word far and wide WATCH out because does not like it when you cancel or switch I would AVOID this company at all costs very dirty and tricky On principle FOR LIFE I never use this company again and warn everyone I know to stay far away from them  
 Too worried about auto fraud that they ended up losing a customer I provided as many documents as I possibly could to provide my Pennsylvania Proof of Residency which they deemed not enough proof  
 I have been a long term auto and home customer with Despite the fact that I had no claims I was constantly hit with continuous and dramatic increases in both the home and auto rates The customer service agents were unhelpful and un empathetic too  
 In November I was involved in a motor accident resulting in my being totaled It was towed to a tow yard and my claim's adjuster was in contact with me right away Within a couple of weeks the towing company contacted me and was prepared to release my but needed verification from to release it We spoke to our claims adjuster Kayla ** and was that would handle everything and we need to worry about it We assumed this meant would handle everything and we need to worry about it That was all we heard about it all other correspondence dealt with the actual accident and not the I bought and when I attempted to renew the registration this month I found out there was a 'wrecker lien' on my license and I would not be able to renew my registration until it was paid I know what a wrecker lien was and after researching it I contacted both and the towing company The towing company explained that not only would I be responsible for paying the cost of the lien but also the cost of the time my was stored in their lot which was days @ per day Once I was finally able to actually speak to someone at I was that there was no coverage for this and responsible for paying What Where was my claims adjuster Kayla ** Surely she could help after all what she assured us when we spoke to her in November Guess what Kayla no longer works there great The gentleman I spoke with today Nick ** while very polite was unable to tell me what happened and why we are now responsible for paying all of these extra expenses when we were misinformed by Clearly if employee Kayla ** had done her job correctly she would have been able to notify us of the same information that Nick ** us and we could have taken care of the situation right away and none of this would be an issue today I realize that is a very large company and has deep pockets and there is no way they be convinced they are responsible for the actions of of their employees even when it ultimately causes damage to of their customers but that is not acceptable They should be held responsible as it is was of their employees who misrepresented information and that places accountability squarely on them  
I approved an amount for my flood and the wrong amount was taken out I call at night when I had time and women who stated she was a supervisor was the most incompetent person I ever did business with Her only solution was that you would have to call back tomorrow I expect my issue to be taken care of no matter what time I call 
 My Jeep Renegade was stolen last Friday the th of Dec I was heading off to a customer to clean her home and noticed I left the vacuum on the porch Key in ignition I up to the steps approx ft away and turned to see and hear my peeling out of the driveway I called police and within min I live in St Louis MO and shocked that my adjuster was in state So she gives me a detailed list of all the things I needed to do like go to police and a report fill out a page questionnaire and did the same over the phone with her So that was done times Since when do I go do all this running to a report their job But the report was not available for days and she did not know But that happens when you the lazy ones Now days later police found abandoned and towed it to impound No keys in the jeep to start it up and yet on report it says driveable so now this adjuster wants me out of the rental and go pick up my jeep No has seen the jeep so why would you let a person claim the and take a chance they do more damage to it and say it was done when thief stole it So she has already stopped the rental but I still have it and have to pay because I do not have a to to my cleaning jobs I own a cleaning business And this is a commercial account The worst experience I have ever had I have that coverage and pay for it and to use for days And have mine back yet But she wants me to go it Not sure if it is ok to drive by a police report that says it is driveable without a key How would they know that She wants me to take it home and the thief still has my keys so it be taken again I really need some advice here because this is unreal I believe an co would put a customer through all this Is this legal Anything I do Should I go the before the adjuster has even seen it Then again I do not know if it is running  
Christmas ruined I recently opened a policy with online I agreed to a payment of I found out the following day that the complete policy payment had drafted from my account This put me in the negative and has of now created in overdraft fees Never open a policy online 
 I have moved from different state to MA and reviewed my Auto policy I was that I need to pay if I pay monthly or If I am paying in the full I receive the discount of and I need to pay Only I enquired the same with the customer service multiple times and I received the same answer To my surprise after paying I am seeing as pending I called the customer service to check but I am not receiving any proper answer They are very adamant and not ready to listen whatever I say They are saying that I need to pay the amount My advice is never go to for policy There are may other people providing good lose your hard earned money  
  is the worst company I have ever dealt with They lowballed the value of my totalled so I took a loss on it They took forever to back to me return my calls or email since spoken with others who've had the same experience with They clearly spend their money our money really that we pay in premiums on advertising and as little as possible on claims It turns my stomach to see their advertising everywhere I look in the air on buses tv It’s disgusting DO NOT BUY If you have a claim you'll regret it  
 I am very unhappy with I switched back to their auto policy and after months of being with them they jacked the rates up for no reason I have perfect driving record for years I even increased my deductibles before this happened and took off some coverages If anything my rates should have went down I plan on switching companies real soon I not go back next time  
 My wife's was struck by a dump truck hard hit threw the over a curb etc Bad hit The was taken to a REPAIR CENTER Huge mistake Everyone there works FOR The adjuster is the dictating and writing the estimate They were very rude to my wife and really had a   bully   attitude to her After days in the shop the was returned with a door that close and wind draft days in the same shop comes back WORSE We took our directly to a MERCEDES dealer and they estimate to fix it properly Now is blaming it on a prior accident before we bought it which was ALSO COVERED by We have a to drive spent thousands in RENTAL without reimbursement and have to hear that OUR fault How precisely differentiate accident from the other and still how they blame on me for not taking care of it in the first place  
 I am and male So I understand that my rates are to be higher advantage I did not know how much CHEAPER I could a policy with BETTER coverage until I left I a ‘ Jeep GC and they charged me for the longest time Well the broke down and it was to be awhile before I could repair it I called to see if they could pause my policy since I driving it the best they could do is give a   storage   policy for month and save my old policy when it is repaired I asked if my rate would go up and they no I it fixed and it switched over month I them what they had me The service person me my policy in general did not go up but due to   uneven spacing   for payments I had to pay up in bigger chunks I WAS STILL PAYING FOR SO THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN So there was no reason to the storage policy because I still had to pay more I stayed with them till that policy ended and they me a new policy I eventually it down to month Keep in mind all of these are for bare MINIMUM coverage mi to work days a week and days a week mi to school mi year Ended up swapping for ‘ Audi They quoted for Well they lied again Instead of saving month I stuck with a bill for month Obviously and are not that big of difference to but is enough for me and it adds up Only good thing about is the people friendly and relatable  
 I had my pristine truck stolen in Texas on September Today is October and I have still not been paid I have talked to supervisors ** both promised to involved After several messages resorting to calling them cowards Mr ** finally returned my th call saying he tried to reach out to me We had never gotten a message My adjuster ** is inexperienced and obviously has no background in claims I have over in documented options on my and he states that they have no value and is doing me a favor by offering me and about % of the appraised value of my truck I would like to add that my wife and I are seasoned independent adjusters and do this for a living so I have some idea as to how these claims should be taken care of If I a settlement this week I be filing suit for bad faith has well trained customer service people who do a good job when you are spending your hard earned monies but the claims department is a joke And by the way ask customer service to involved with your claim because they cannot help with that In my opinion if Mr ** is really a supervisor he is incapable of doing the job and needs to be replaced So much for helping the veterans as they advertise  
 Received a letter for examination under oath but they scheduled it same day as my court date So I had left several different voicemails that was never returned Also I wrote an email that was on the letter to leave paper trail behind Woke up this morning I decided give them a call again Finally someone picks up and transfers me to Ellen She is rude and not helpful at all Talks over you tries to make it seem like you are in the wrong when they have not returned any of my calls or email then wanted to argue with me stating she sent out the letter so she knows what's on it & I was supposed to write a letter to reschedule my appointment but clearly on the letter I received in black and white stated if I need to reschedule to contact office Nowhere did it state to write a letter So then she it was out of her hands to contact the adjuster Adam That he is the only person that do something at this point and hung up Clearly they are unorganized and I am insured with I mean is the legal team supposed to be working with me or against me Why do I pay my auto every month for this crap Who else I contact to assistance  
 I switched to almost a year ago because of their lower rates I have two drivers and two on my policy I recently purchased a third and added it to my policy However minutes after I added the to the policy my fiance was driving it and the throttle stuck which ended up causing an accident within a mile of our home The accident occurred due to a mechanical defect and the driver was of the insured drivers on my policy I sent all the necessary documents to the claims department and was assigned a representative to handle my claim I then waited a month and when I still hadn't heard anything about what was on with the claim I made several attempts over the next three weeks to contact my claims representative I left five messages and called at least a dozen times None of my calls were returned I then called and left a message for his supervisor My call was not returned I made several more attempts to contact anyone in claims and was unable to reach anyone over the past several weeks I then received a letter in the mail stating that my damages were not to be covered because the accident involved a not listed on my policy I am an insured driver and a paying customer with three on my policy who has never had an accident in my life until now I have paid for for thirty years and have never filed a claim but when I need them to pay out I even anyone on the phone then am denied for an illegitimate reason They then proceeded to raise my rates per month because of a   high volume of accidents in my area    I spoke with someone in customer service and was given this explanation for the increase and that everyone's rates in my area have gone up because otherwise the company have enough to pay out for all the claims filed It seems like they do anything to avoid actually having to pay out for a claim yet they advertise a quick and easy claims process and affordable rates which have become a little less affordable if you happen to live in my area apparently I have never felt less valued as a customer nor have I ever been treated with less regard and decency by a group of so called   professionals   in my life  
 I moved to state and my original provide coverage in my current location I called and a quote which the cheapest but it was OK I them I wanted it and put money on the policy I also them my daughter a ticket a couple weeks ago Two days later I an email from Underwriter's requesting a call I called them and they tell me that my policy was up a little to the tune of per month I them the first guy knew everything and quoted me the lower price I asked why and they the policy had to approved through underwriting first I expressed my displeasure and I was they would have to take it to a supervisor and would back to me in two days I want to do business with a company like this so I went and through major company and saved per month over their original quote I guess I should thank them And yes I asked my current company if the price was to go up in two days They me that a lot of companies send the initial policies to underwriting after the client accepts the policy so not final till then My current company did the underwriting while I was on the phone  
 This company is completely non responsive I have gotten in touch with them since the day of accident every week two weeks to resolve this claim It was a crash I was at fault and it so happens that the that hit me was a policy holder as well They have kicked me around to different associates and auto adjusters and no has had a resolve for me I have left several messages over the past few months with the correct auto adjuster Kim ** she never back to me Every time I called and spoke to an associate or someone on the team they acted like it was the first time I had ever spoke with them They would say they were writing down notes and next time I called I would have to rehash all the details every time I called Then they would act shocked to find out that it was a crash and say they have to investigate it EVERY TIME Mind you they have the police report which clearly states that it was a crash Keep in mind the person who hit me was a policy holder I have tried to in touch with the supervisor twice leaving messages They never call back I am completely an unsatisfied customer and would NEVER refer anyone to them  
 ran me through the wringer driving all over town trying to my fixed per their conditions after of their clients crashed into me A month later now my is still not fixed I understand why this website has so many good ratings while other sites are full of experiences similar to mine 
 Brandon ** adjust with Seattle Automotive with aftermarket parts in a months old Prius with miles The only guarantee that he knows for the aftermarket rear tail light is a   lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer   is this a joke I take estimates for and by myself I feel that those adjusters are dealing in behalf of   Seattle Automotive   instead of me because they are generous with the body shop at the same time that are saving in aftermarket parts to my cost Craig ** Kyle ** also   supervisors   are more of the same always telling   That's the policy    but nothing clear about official guarantee or a quality of the aftermarket parts The aftermarket part where they are saving is the rear tail light The leasing company accept any external different with the original different color in the future or different bright or water inside if is an aftermarket tail light When you call to the main number they only give the number of the supervisor David ** that is the supervisor but never take a callback Seattle Automotive is a recommended body shop at the website  
I was involved in an accident on It has taken them months to process the claim then they lied and they would pay the medical bills directly to the chiropractor and never did Instead they paid me for the inconvenience and my time out of work and the doctor their costs was to come out of that Now I have these medical bills that I expecting to have to pay 
 My wife was involved in an accident where she was rear ended by when she tried to merge to left on a two lane road as the right lane was coned ahead for construction work at mph on the left lane rear ended her when she almost merged and the driver after the incident that he did not see the lane merge warning and was not expecting her to merge We were under the impression that since she was rear ended it is usually the fault of the driver behind but the agent was quick to tell us that it is our fault since we should have been careful merging whether or not it is the construction zone and lane was blocked off and he even that he has not spoken to the other party involved who was from insurer I understand why would not spend time doing their homework It was a very minor incident with my damages about and the other about I am pretty sure they are raise my rates so bad to force me to out of We had the best price from for the last yrs and never had any claims since both of us started driving years ago  
 Warning scams its customers and here is my story I called in March to ask about my coverage and of my questions was if I have for a cracked windshield after being transferred three times I was yes but since it was deductible no coverage anyway which makes sense NOW seven months later I find out that they created a claim without telling me And as a result my premiums are up and I even a decent premium from because of this fake claim I again spoke to three different departments today but was that this is how it works BS is my response since I never had a claim in the first place and they not remove it So meanwhile I had to call them seven times to change my address on top of this What else is on here These people cannot be trusted anymore A friend of mine almost killed in her own driveway Guess how much paid Yes the commercials are great and they used to be good but it is time for consumers to speak and find company Thank you for reading this  
I was hit by a customer on She admitted fault and we exchanged info Apparently the practices at are to record you and ask you a series of questions that incriminate you and have what's deemed shared negligence I was not at fault and they Lyndon and Emily bullied me into accepting % of the estimate instead of the % I was due Those two individuals out of Macon Georgia have no business in the industry They are horrible phone bullies They refused to help me a phone number for their client while I was nothing but forthcoming with them from the start 
 I called in on a Saturday afternoon to refer my client to switch over to because his current company is always closed on weekends which made it extremely inconvenient for him Worst experience ever had with this company and in the process of pulling my family's own policy and switching The broker asked for his name address date of birth and social security number then she me to hang up having her own assumption that he's not a good enough long term customer without any explanation She kept insisting that we hang up and would not provide a quote I asked to speak to her supervisor and he kept insisting that it was a miscommunication and she made a wrong assumption Worst customer service ever experienced and pulling my family's auto policy with this company No more future referrals  
 I called to a day extension on my payment seeing as I dropped my whole check on my payments Anyways I was not to worry because if I have the money in the account it'd take at least days before it checked the account again It took it out the day AFTER it was supposed to be due and made me go under Thankfully responsible and was able to cover it I like my account messed with and when a rep tells you something is to go way and it goes another Nah gonna go with AAA or someone else is AWFUL  
 They say they are military friendly but they are not They gave me a first quote at reasonable price but second time they skyrocketed my premium with all condition being same I called them talked to different individual but they change their mind Be aware from them USAA is military friendly not

I receive a call from Brittany ** yesterday and she is mind I have a accident on October and when I tell her I have a Lawyer she no want to talking with me and hung my call and she no want to tell me nothing about my or about my rental 
 I have had auto for years and I am now in my first claim with them and it is horrible It is worse than being in the accident which was not my fault Of the people I have had to be in communication with only was worth talking to and that was Colby ** Due to the plethora of sloppy claims agents I have moved on to auto company They are cheap for a reason because they handle they claims cheap and slow It is like to Walmart to process your auto claim They are that insufficient in their quality of service  
We have had for twenty years and I had an accident where my truck jackknifed in my driveway They charged me two deductibles and then boosted my auto over dollars per year Why do we penalized for ACCIDENTS First accident I remember and in my own driveway no other involved and then deductible and my goes up a year for three years That is RIDICULOUS 
 Martekki ** at has made it the worst experience ever for me My was totaled my sister was terribly injured and the attitude Martekki gave me on the phone was completely uncalled for She does not deserve to represent I used to make k a year as well as a customer service rep years ago when I was So I understand her frustration I feel terribly sorry for anybody who has to speak with her about an issue She laughed and made sarcastic remarks about my being totaled and my sister being injured been thinking about it for a couple days and had to write this review Martekki ** thanks for the bad experience  
 We have been with over twenty years and have four insured with them However I called to an extension on our policy from the to time We have always paid automatically from check Since I recently lost my husband and had to move I needed some grace for payment refused the extension and cancelled our policy Never use these guys I found top rated company and so much cheaper  
 Got a hit and run on my Went to to report it Found out I had Limited Collision and they not cover any cost to fix it You see Limited Collision has some fine print If you do not know who hit your you are screwed Not good while your is new and you still owe and pay per month for it There are no agents that talk with you when you are buying a policy an agent some professional help and them money you think you are savings with is nothing I hope other avoid selecting the Limited Collision feature and go Collision The people were not interested in any negotiation to help So now we pulled all our and house away from and moved to Agency  
 My neighbor's truck burned and damaged my would not even attempt to recoup the loss and my deductible with their person telling me why should the other party pay for something not their fault Guess it escapes her that not my fault either Might be cheaper in the short term but clearly not in the long run  
Company needs to be investigated Four years after an accident the wife & I are still suffering from our injuries and no settlement Do not do business with this company They take your money but never absolutely never pay out Too busy suckering people in with the lizard which is actually an appropriate mascot Cold blooded & not American 
 I have been with for over years and they do not stand behind their polices I have uninsured motorist coverage on my policy and the claim they they would pay for the claim due to a accident not involving And they automotive shop has started their work on the Now they want us to pick the up and say they want a investigator to look at the first which they tell us when or how long this take Yet we are traveling from city to city due to employment I call the supervisor Scott yesterday and instead of him returning my call he allowed the same staff member who was nasty to call back and stated that his supervisor that   You Andrew relay the message to them Nothing has change    What happen to being helpful and courteous and calling back since I call you Also what happens when you give a auto repair to make repairs and then you change your mind What happens if there is more wrong with my now since telling me to take it right now in the middle of repairs is to liable for my or not since they approved the auto repair prior They take your premium of every month for total coverage  
 I have been with for almost years Never had any problems Never had any accidents until now When I signed up with I had a Pathfinder When I bought a new I emailed informing them of all the necessary changes I no longer have the Pathfinder I have an Pathfinder etc I received email back from and that was that I thought I was good to go NEVER UPDATED MY INFORMATION SO now after my accident they are not taking responsibility for my liability not help me after I pay every month regularly tells me that not insured What kind of bull is that I pay every month every month Why am I even paying for then For me this has been a nightmare

  cancelled my policy without notice When I called to inquire & complain they explained it was an oversight on their end preventing me from driving my for the weekend until they could notify the RMV When I them that was unacceptable and to keep the cancellation as I would be with a different company they then state they need me to send a letter in writing requesting to cancel which even make sense  
 When I moved out of home temporarily changed my rates for an address change I called back times Every time I call different person kept raising my rate to triple for DAY I had to change the company differently from my spouse since they tripled up my rate for address change When I moved back home did not give me the same rate before the address change so I kept my different company home company raised the rate because of different company I got They give me the previous rate from the previous address keeps looking for the excuses for raising rates call them They'll find the new reason to raise the rate as your son a Driver's License ask you to prove that you own your for rental I had to pay for Notary already has information of my ownership They give you hard time always lose when collision occurs and the other party's at fault even when you provide video evidence Their legal team is weak  
 Earlier this year my spouse and I were sideswiped by an uninsured motorist My spouse and I were both injured but my injuries were more extreme took care of my because it was totaled out but then came the song and dance for medical pain and suffering I asked the initial claims associate “Should I legal representation    from day but she assured me that they handle all of that far from the truth To make a long story short I went to my physician and chiropractor for multiple visits required Once I them I might be finished with my visits then came the determination of bills and pain and suffering I changed around to different adjusters in that time The last had the nerve to asks me how much I thought I should receive out of the accident stupid question right Needless to say we settle for anywhere near the amount I wish I had gotten a lawyer from the start but who figures you'd have to go after your own company Stay VERY VERY clear away from this company The couple bucks you save is not worth it when you really have to use them Absolute HORRIBLE company And I was with them over years their loss  
 I called to a policy and was I owe from my policy so I paid the dollars I owed When I was transferred to an agent I am I am being held liable for a policy from that was cancelled on July of this year I let them know I have not owned a since when I had an accident at which time I notified that I and my ex were estranged and that is still on file I ask the lady to tell me why he was not on my policy She   He was reported as your estranged spouse    I   Okay so how is it that I owe you for any new policy after the policy    She replied   We were not notified of you and him being estranged    I   You agent me it is on record as an estranged spouse    I   Is that right ”   Yes ma’am    she   but we were different in    I   By me    She   No ma’am by him    I   So telling me I did not let you know so I am liable for his policy because he we were a family and I lived there ” I   Okay what license did you on me    She   a SC license    I   And you insured a SC driver on a NC policy all because someone I was living there    The answer I is that I owe them Anyone put me on a policy so hey everyone put your ex spouse on policy They hold him her responsible when I them we were no longer together and they I did but I did not in I guess we all have to go through the phone book and call every company annually to let them know we are no longer together  
  hit by any of their customers They put used or nds parts on and not give the body shop any money to work with You have to fix bend parts and paint only as little as can They if you wash it a few time you be able to tell the difference I come do that the adjuster has NO clue of auto's works As they say what comes around goes around 
 I was in an accident where driver ran a red light and hit my I immediately called the police and then The agent on the phone did not the information right All she kept asking for was a recorded statement from the driver my mother a year old woman who has nearly been killed minutes before When I contacted them the next day they asked me for the other driver's information I had to go to the police station to this although I knew she was also insured by since I saw their blue envelope in her hand She never apologized The police gave her a ticket based on a witnesses report It gets worse from here They do no investigation I sent them the police report and they still refuse to waive my deductible They send an adjuster to do an estimate for three weeks They totaled my which was in mint condition and inspected and serviced two weeks earlier The medical claims department is even worse I think they are to deny all claims When I was at the hospital to an ultrasound to check for internal bleeding their medical examiner the hospital there was no record of my claim because they receive the form Their mail sits for two weeks in their office You never speak to the same person twice unless they are hounding you for a treatment plan so they limit their liability and end your claim My is still sitting I am in constant pain and I had trouble to find any doctors that accept no fault STAY AWAY FROM They are your worst nightmare and they should be investigated  
 care about customer satisfaction All they want to increase their fee every months and neglect the customer feedback at all Stay away from this company if you want to ripped off I found better with better price and better service 
  is terrible The uneducated poor mannered adjuster named Zunisha was awful I called to follow up on a status of an auto claim and she was so rude She did not want to listen to my question or concern She straight out cuts you off and does not let you finish a sentence She speaks over you and goes on with what she has to say I hope hire better educated employees to represent their company I think I am ever back to You lost a customer of eight years  
 I am a policyholder and was hit by policyholder who was at fault I had to put my in the shop for over a week for repairs and rather than do it right away and rent a locally I waited week until I went on vacation and rented a Since I was not in the city where the accident occurred did not honor the rental So did not have to pay anything for rental coverage on this claim and did not offer any compensation I have cancelled both my auto policy and boat policy as a result  
 My was totaled by a rear end collision at a red light completely the other driver's fault They had Dealing with was a nightmare They return calls and testy on the phone when I did them They only gave me days in a rental after waiting for weeks to one Their phone lines were always busy but leaving a message was pointless because they would not follow up call back or complete the claim process without them on the phone and demanding they do their job When I finally did a real person and demanded they work on my claim the girl Quasha aggravated and me she had other claims to process She actually me not to call her back So my advice is that when you find out that is the company of the person who hit you deal with them directly Hire an attorney and let them deal with them  
 is absolutely fantastic until you actually into an accident and then they are literally the worst company is existence After incident they keep raising your rates until you walk away I went back to Mercury where I was for years and should have stayed DO NOT be taken by the cheaper rates is a scam of the highest order 
 When I started this policy I was set to a month I a traffic ticket and went up on me to a month Now they went up on me at a month  
 I attempted to log into my account online day and found that I was locked out and to call customer service When I did I was that I be locked out of my account for months because I   used too many credit cards to pay my bill    I used up some Visa gift cards I had and I was paying my entire policy at time Apparently they have an unwritten policy that if you use too many credit cards you be treated like a second class customer and not allowed to log into your account online I was that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to wait until my policies renews months later and they care if I canceled my policy or not So ** 'em I canceled it And I never do business with again Why do they care how many credit cards I use especially when paying the whole thing at once If you are to have a policy like they maybe you should tell people about it Or better yet stop them if they try to use a second credit card not to be treated like a criminal or a second class customer They lost a good customer for life What idiots running this company  
 Save % or more More like costs % or more Even though I was in my late s and have in the UK and France did not take this into consideration when I needed On the other hand when I renewed I year later Liberty Mutual offered me % less premium offered to match it failed to offer any rebate for my first year when they charged me % more Yet still they send me letters asking to come back Or a good way to runs business maybe you should take a closer look at your corporate policies  
 About a month and a half ago my family and I were moving into our new home My oldest son and I were about to drop off a load when a teenage girl covered by and driving on a supervisional license blew through a stop sign and slammed into my driver side back tire pulled my drive shaft out of my transmission and tweaked my back axle The body shop suggested to hand my truck for over a month I picked it up yesterday took it home I come outside a few hours later and a big puddle of transmission fluid on the ground I call the shop the shop calls adjuster and I a call from the adjuster and he says   Well we're gonna go ahead and pay for it to towed back and put you in rental but we're to inspect it and if I think wear and tear you'll be responsible for all costs    I him that my truck never leaked anything he   well real convenient for you to say    How could he even tell me that First off your teenage client who of been driving alone ripped my drive shaft from my transmission The body shop recommended and replaced the drive shaft but he's to tell me it might be wear and tear I am contacting my lawyer This is worst company ever dealt with  
 Put a claim in against a client of theirs for driving backwards down a residential street on the wrong side while I was backing out of my driveway I stopped when I saw him coming but it was too late With only foot of my hanging over the end of my driveway he managed to hit me anyway he never saw my looking Police officer he was % in the wrong no need for witnesses which I had only accept % liability So far it has cost them more than the damage to my to keep their employees on the telephone arguing Also is refusing to use my witnesses due to the fact that I know them This happened in a residential area that their client belong in And of course I know my neighbors So for new clients of theirs or potential clients be aware that they waste a lot of your trying to out of paying even the smallest of claims My claim was for less than and they've to date wasted over fighting it I intend to stop till I a resolution  
  is terrible I had a minor accident recently The police report clearly stated that it was not my fault However stated that they only partially pay my claim stating that both parties were liable adjuster stated that   We disregard the police report and assess our own liability    You cannot reason with them I tried My recommendation for you to find a better company There is no reason why anyone would want to stay with such a terrible company If anyone provide suggestions please do  
 My husband's hit with the engine obviously dented while packed As a result of the accident the transmission of the affected and everything thereafter started malfunctioning We contacted and they fixed the body and the transmission They had us dragging and to deal with obviously because it costed more Of course they love to collect and keep your cash but never want to spend it on the reason the cash is being collected for The transmission affected as an effect of the accident and kept on saying we had no enough proof since March the went for oil change at Honda days before the accident without a fault I have never felt confused in my life before nor openly ripped off by this act we have been through hell with having to drop off our kids at daycare at end my husband at the other end of town and my job and school is at stake because of having to drive all about town for our daily running and living because of the distance In essence has rendered the useless by saying   we have no enough proof   and we have been paying for the since the incident in March From customer service I keep his name to the last man i e The adjuster it has been a horrible experience There has been inconsistencies and lots of dragging about this clear issue we have with them I NEVER encourage a prospect to this company and sure this experience go as far as those who have ears and care to listen Humanly they may have   cheated us   so to say but I know God visit this case as I stay up tonight to tender this case because HE is the final judge NEVER AGAIN  
 Someone vandalized my and I called claims to report the incident The person on the other side of the phone made a note in the system that it was hit by the door of I him that it hit by door and I know what happened as I present when the incident took place He bother to change the statement and marked it as collision damage instead of comprehensive damage because I have a deductible on collision damage and deductible on comprehensive damage When I argued with him he the adjuster make that determination So I took an appointment for inspection the next day with the adjuster and the adjuster looked at the notes and me that it looks like it was hit by door and would be collision damage After arguing with him for couple of minutes he changed his story and me that it was hit by a white while it was backing up and it has left some paint on my I him it was not paint and dust and he it was still hit by So the adjuster has no knowledge of what he was talking about and went forward with the collision damage as he knew I had a deductible I reached out to his supervisor and manager and they asked me to come for the inspection for second time They repeated the same thing that it was hit by door or or an object and would be considered as collision damage They were not sure what happened and assumed it was a collision damage so they the money out of my pocket The damage looks like someone kicked the door and vandalized my I have been with for over and half years and how they treat their valuable customer I am so disappointed with I probably look for provider who values their customer  
I was hit by a person insured by I have not been given a rental I was hurt in the wreck It totaled my and my thumb is dislocated I am too outraged this is how they handle people I be filing a class action suit 
 First I would thank God that I have I rear ended I was at complete stop and she was driving around mph on a mph speedily freeway The lady who was driving admitted that it was her fault Me and my girlfriend had pain in our backs Lady seems very scared I asked her   are you ok you drive Is your ok    Then came back home and talked to and I asked them   I wanna go to a doctor and make sure everything is ok I want any pre authorization or anything like that I pay for my visit and take care of it later    After everything seems ok took care of my damages but denied my medical claims I provided them with pictures of doctor's visit his name my medicine Walgreens receipt which has date and time and everything they still denied it When I asked them why they me that they think that the pain is because of accident I them   can you prove it because you are thinking but I am giving you the proof that I went to a doctor and my medicine    I am still in touch with but they think that the pain is because of the accident but they prove it So at all and if you hit good luck dealing with Proof is in the stars at ConsumerAffairs com they star think about it  
 Raised our policy premium SIX times with zero claims From the time we signed up the first months they raised the rates That was our reward for driving perfect Fact No added or change of No added or change of drivers Value of the on the policy declined However rates went up times We called Their first reason for the increase was a driver reached the age of Keep in mind our value declined as well Their reason for their nd increase was the number of accidents in our zip code What about the rd increase th increase th increase th increase with zero claims Investigating with the Dept of our zip code and complaining about excessive rate increases We have receipts policies that support these facts What we do not have is a report that supports increases  
 My dad hit my in the driveway but even though we had separate insurances from they charged my for the damage instead of considering it a collision on my dad's policy I was there was a law behind that and when I asked to send a copy of the law they failed and never send it After I my repaired I left and signed up for State Farm and they are way better than these guys I definitely am to make sure none of my friends and family screwed by these guys  
 Every renewal my policy goes up which I understand I have any points or accident or tickets I talk to the rep They always says nothing I did I had other insurances I never had this problem I think does the bait and switch They you in with a low rate then hit you every renewal with higher rates should be investigated about their practice  
 Have been a customer for more than years filing only claim ever for to pay for damage resulting from my scraping a curb when exiting an unlit area following my exercise class After the claim my policy was increased I was as reason to reimburse for the same amount I was then that this was required by the state of Va Further an additional reason offered was that my rate increase was required to share the cost of other claims made in my area Ashburn Virginia where the algorithm was largely used to identify my share of the cost I have a homeowners and liability policy with in addition to my auto I am considering a change from  
 I was rear ended on August th of this year It a horrible accident damage to my back bumper I was sitting at a red light when a customer slammed into the back of me I filed a claim later that day still waiting for someone to even look at my I have been by different adjusters that simply waiting for the other party to provide proof of coverage THIS PERSON IS INSURED BY YOU you should know if they have coverage or not I had to go to the ER for my head and neck My head bounced off the steering wheel and then came back Thankfully the airbag did not deploy because if it would have I would have been hurt even more Since filing the claim I have been advised that it would be best if I file this accident under my own policy and then let both companies handle it I do for a living That is not how works at all If at fault you are held liable for the damage and responsibilities that comes with driving I not pay out of pocket of my own money to my fixed and my policy to pay for the medical cost and then have my rate go up and I be punished when I am NOT at fault is advising people false information I have left my claim's adjuster multiple voicemails and has yet to return any of them very disappointment with this whole situation I have NEVER been involved in any type of accident and I pray I never do specialty with someone who is insured by This is ridiculous to have to hassle and track down people I have all the gentlemen's information that hit me spoken to him directly since the accident and even he has stated that he has scanned faxed and email all information that has requested to move forward with the claim the very first week of the accident So here we are September and still waiting to have this resolved disappointment and upset  
 After an accident I gave representative Tierra an opportunity to investigate an accident involving of their clients I gave phone number of two witnesses to investigate an accident The woman Tierra was very unknowledgeable and inexperienced investigating anything I give them every opportunity has a client lied to them to make things right The woman had a negative attitude and really cannot understand what she was saying I gave them contact information for two witnesses They never even came and look at the that was hit never even looked at the that was hit And of course their outcome was negative and denied my claim I called her supervisor Mark and gave him every opportunity to make things right They refused to do so Luckily I was able to footage actual video footage of the accident So what could have caused in auto repairs end up costing him over in legal fees damages lost time to clients lost wages over a decision they could have been made very simply by having a well experienced individual doing a job that they are qualified for I would do everything in my power to make sure that the public is aware of ’s poor quality service I be notifying the newspaper and the Better Business Bureau as well  
 I have been with since and every months it gets worse and worse These people has a lie for everything you ask them First off I ask why every months do my go up when I had any accidents and every rep that I have talked to gives me the same line   I live here too in Georgia and mine’s go up also    PURE LIES So this goes on every months for years sure others have heard this same bs Now here is the real kicker I called on Sept to make a payment that was past due of which consist of me changing my due date from the th to the th of Aug and was that I only owe to close out my old policy from July to Sept and for her to quote me a new policy I would have to pay the I agreed to pay the The rep proceeded to let me know that we are recording the conversation and I agreed again I asked her “With it being that paying on the th would my payments be due on the th ” She yes I her that I want my payments to be on the th She that would be fine but I would have to pay on Sept th mo + for changing the date from Sept th to th at a prorate The conversation even went so far as to me making split payments of by Oct th so the system not take a payment in full I repeated everything she to me With all of this being here it is Sept and looking at my card statement and I see where there was a payment of taken out of my account mins after the was taken out I called and spoke with a rep about it and she tells me nothing she do about it I her to me a manager supervisor I was put on hold again and a Regina ** came on and proceeded to explain to me what I already know about my and having a lien I had to interrupt her and explain again what happened and I want my refund for the that I authorize She again tried to explain away the reason why it was taken out And I again explained to her that I need my money back because I have to make my payment She obviously care She then for me to hold on again and she do my refund She then comes back and says that I have to send a email requesting a cancellation of in order for me to my refund and I would have to wait hrs for it to be reviewed and then I would have to wait business days to my refund I her “You you were giving me my refund Now you come back with THIS ” By this time really INFURIATED I her “So now to make me wait until late next week to my refund and be late with my payment ” I am so through with I cannot believe how HORRIBLE they have become I care if I have to pay more elsewhere What difference does it make They keep raising the prices anyway They really suck  
Tried to cancel my policy due to a better quote from someone else Cancelled over the phone then had been I need to send an email stating that I was canceling ok done The rep I would be a full refund for the payment that taken out I woke up the next morning and my policy was still active I called and they I had to speak to a cancellation representative whatever that is I spoke with Her and she started asking why was I leaving and who was I to next Then she me that I would only be a partial refund like wtf If that was true then why did the former reps from the day before say I was a full refund They need to train people according to standards Talking about that NC has a clause saying if I cancel I would only receive partial payment smh a scam 
 I recently had an accident involving a person with all I had on my was liability is saying the accident was my fault even though the I hit turned left in front of me I am happy that I do not contribute to this organization I had to file a complaint with the commission to them to take a statement from me about the accident I was off work for days with injuries resulting from the accident and they still not pay any doctor bills So if they treat me in this manner think how you be treated as a customer  
 Will cancel you and raise your premium for no reason I made a payment on the due date there was some fraudulent activity come through my account so when I found out the check was returning I made the payment with my credit card accepted it no problem online until a week later when I a cancellation notice They cancelled my policy me they would refund the payment less a return item fee in to days and if I wanted to restart my policy they jacked the rate up total scam artists I am a single mother who had her budget for the month set around the prior payment schedule BEWARE They NOT WORK WITH YOU NO MATTER HOW many years you have been with them Have left me and my son out in the cold and the lady who was   supposed   to help me Laura was as rude as she could be me I had no reason to be upset

I a much better quote with Allstate and called to cancel my with I them I would be canceling for the rd and would be starting my new on the th Come to find out after pulled over my registration had been cancelled due to a lapse in my Apparently if you cancel on the rd they give you for that day at all So I have coverage for the rd and now I am stuck with trying to registration for a that had an lapse Such a pain The representative from could have advised me to cancel in the th instead They suck and they are overpriced Go to Allstate Personal service and a way better company 
They first me a couple of reasons for their denying I provide further evidences to dispute their so called reasons They me I do not have strong evidence and based on overall evaluation their deny still remain I asked on the phone about evidence I provided but clearly they do not know them and saying something unrelated While I asked further investigation she my case is not worthy for continuing investigation and simply hang up the phone from her end while I am talking 
 Read before buying After years with I had a small collision driving out from my parking space All solved good customer service but they increased my month policy from to Went online Mad quotes multiple no tickets except of the accident I have the same results I know what they did and who allows an company to do that for a small accident I switched now but it still paying a lot They most likely write something more than what happened on my history old Imagine if I was a teenager  
 My was vandalize purse and wallet were stolen out of my trunk Thieves shattered passenger side window to in Called I was informed I have Comprehensive coverage and that vandalism and glass would be repaired Phone again for follow up and was I was responsible for paying to replace glass due to cost of repair being under deductible Oh and vandalism is covered under RENTER'S not auto Utterly useless

I have my policy set up with the automatic pay and on our due date they processed the payment but they had a problem on their end and double charged me Sent us a notice days later with an alert and it was to be hrs before it would be fixed I was charged fees on my banking because of their error because it took longer than hours to fix They me to send them my banking statement so I reimburse But by that time the nd charge was taken off money put back in and we were left with the fees and they reimburse because they see their mistake I be shopping as soon as renewal is due not stay with a company that takes your money whenever they feel like it and not inform you for a nd payment A lot of people are struggling because of this other bills to worry about 
 I recently switched my auto to and while the first couple months were smooth there has been a widespread problem in which auto billing accounts are being double drafted This draft which was not corrected until after called numerous times and a week had gone by caused me over overdraft fees to my bank account The company is still   reviewing   my claims over a week later and has yet to return the money I need to make my rent tomorrow is completely unwilling to speed up the process after their system flaw has caused financial issues for so many customers  
I have renters last year I never did automatic payment nor renewal They take out off my bank account Did not know my bank info was save in their system for them to take money whenever they want to Please people do not renters policy with crooks 
 I was in a severe Auto accident on July where my husband and I were injured The accident was not our fault and both sides have We have paid our payment for years and have personal injury protection to cover our lost wages been almost weeks and still no paycheck excuse after and delay after another Husband has to be off work at least weeks and it feels like because of what they do to their own that we may have to apply for food stamps Totally wrong  
 Threats investigators and simple claims of under They rip Every time I have tried to file a claim they put through the ringer with person after person and then interrogations by the rudest most condescending arrogant idiot in the company I would never give them the life raft in a sinking boat or food or water if they were dying  
 I was misinformed by their agent who assure me that I would not have any problems Nonetheless all I from was an apology nothing and nothing more Their lack of knowledge and trained agents cost me x more than what I would have originally pay  
 I the policy and good that I I think the policy was bad but the customer service was the worst I lived at NYC for years I recently moved from NYC to Providence RI very happy to my first I had definitely drove for years back home but my US license months back I called customer service gave her details Her name was Amber I had heard from my friends that if I have more years of driving my rate be less even if I drove in other country So I her to have multiple years in my profile She gave me a quote of mth for month or price of months upfront I chose previous She checked my driver's license and me that this is valid if I am taking policy for registered at New York but not at RI as I have that many years in US So now my policy be a month I was still okay and genuinely asked her if there is a possibility to from NYC since I recently moved and my husband was still living there This was a query from a customer to be better informed Now she tells me it might be an fraud because I asked her this question I was doing this for the first time in my life and it was a customer question Then I discussed with my husband and asked her if I could cancel sooner than month you think that was legitimate question Here's what she   I overheard you and your husband discussing and since you are not thinking of commitment I would advice you to go to local broker who may be able to find a better policy for you If you want with us you have to pay x months full payment today or we cannot give you    Now who has that much money when you recently moved and buying a I was so furious and asked to speak for her supervisor Liveda She was no help because I accepted to pay monthly for month but she kept on insisting of upfront months payment I agree that many are to be paid upfront but she me that I could do monthly payment or months upfront If you have a excellent credit score and you this treatment no trust even agreed to have a contract by overhearing husband wife's conversation and asking legitimate question then definitely not for me  
 I'm with FOR ALMOST YEARS I never had any accident why I never had customer experience with This is the first time I need help from and I even explain in words How Horrible was it On June th an Uninsured motorist hit me hard from the back on the red light in the middle lane They agree no fault collision cause by an Uninsured motorist but they still investigating for almost two month to verify he's uninsured motorist Even I already provided the police report already more than a month ago Every time I talk to customer service agent I gotta hear a new story Also they have promised me three times my adjuster call me back in a day or two and it has been weeks I receive any call Even if I call they connect me to her Also I had accidental forgiveness because I never had any accident even the dealing with no fault accident Even any customer service agent was not able to answer what happened to my accident forgiveness credit all they say for some reason it show on my account anymore I thought is corporate company Nationwide not someone family own business All demanding or expecting a professional customer experience Am I wrong What should I do Where should I go Even I ask cust relation or corporate contact then provide it to me  
 I was doing online quote it I qualified for for months I have so I went ahead and did it Paid my down payment then email that they charge me but I had to call them to start policy I called they then me I had a balance from yrs before and kept my money so now I am without and money and they refund my money back to me  
 So it all started about June th my wife to take my to a wash As she was backing up with my new and started pulling forward some old lady backed up and hit my We both have so we filed a claim because the old lady did not want to file nothing Then called her she admitted to hitting my then she called back in and stated that she was caught off guard and she did not hit us we hit her We submitted pictures and videos to we also had the manager of the wash as a witness give a letter with his information that he witnessed the accident states our fault or no fault We argued and finally still no luck because this company is a fraud Then after month the manager says that they'll pay half my deductible which is still bs because they had a witness statement So I decided to lose this and let them fix it because I was not winning and wanted my fixed Wanting to take my new Ford Fusion hybrid to Ford for repairs they convinced me that there recommended shop could fix it Me like an idiot agreed this was Cooks Collision We did the walk around the Before everything matched up color called 'darkside metallic' Ok then days later I go pick up my At first glance I noticed it did not match at all the manager at Cooks he all they did was clear the rear bumper which then I replied   still paint    Now my bumper is shades darker and also it shines green while the rest of my has a blue metallic in it Also has dirt in the paint and the trunk did not align at all noise coming from the passenger side and burn marks in the paint Called took the back very next day because they brought my out at pm when they closed made me wait an hour for it After I took it back and left it there the manager stated that they cannot fix it which means they suck as auto collision center Talked to my adjuster who works hand in hand with Cooks and she that she seen the and it shines I her she needs a new career if she cannot see the difference Went back to my still not happy Contacted over times now nothing is being done What the hell do I do I paid for this less than months ago and they screwed it up and nowhere fast Worst company ever  
 Went online to a quote to compare auto and homeowners rates multiple and these idiots have now sent DMV a notice that of my has lapsed liability coverage I found their rates to be unsatisfactory and did not choose to do business with them How they have any right to do this is beyond me My policy with my current insurer is in good standing and current Where does off sending anything to DMV concerning policy information they have nothing to do with in the first place Never done any business with them and ever do any with them for sure now Created a mess for me to have to deal with because I a quote from them and decided not to a policy from them because they were overpriced So they decide to send a letter to DMV telling them my policy is lapsed not a policy they wrote not a policy that is lapsed not a policy they know anything about What the heck is this Seriously Sending a letter to the DMV because a potential customer chooses not to switch over to your company because you beat their current insurer's rates Telling the DMV an outright lie about that potential customer's liability being lapsed when it is definitely and beyond doubt probably not Are you people looking for a lawsuit Beware of this company If this is how they screw up a simple quote how badly are they to screw up handling a policy Complete and utter idiots Way to go FLO blew it You showed me the competitor's price and yours alright And you showed me how badly you screw up too even have to be a customer to screwed over by you idiots You be hearing from me The state board The DMV The BBB and probably my attorney Not to mention I hope a lot of people from different posting boards before this is over  
 Amanda ** is the adjuster on an accident for of her clients Her client hit me I was hit on a Friday Called on Monday The adjuster was out of the office I called my They there was nothing they could do unless we put in a claim on our Tuesday I called her office once and she had went to lunch time no answer and a third time and finally a hold of her She took my statement and me that she has not received the statement from her client so she could not make a decision on liability I emailed her the police report clearly stating her client is at fault in the accident I confirmed with her that she received the email I spoke to her client directly on Tuesday and she that they had in fact taken a statement Today Wednesday I was in contact with her again today about a rental She she had not received a statement I was in contact yet again with the client directly and they claimed they had given TWO statements and were set up to give a third statement in a few short minutes We were in contact yet again with the adjuster and she gave myself and my father nothing but problems After much back and forth with us and the adjuster as well as the client with the adjuster the adjuster called us to inform us that take responsibility for % of the damages caused to my due to the fact that I did not take evasive action when it is also clearly stated on the police report that I was prevented from doing so by other people in the parking lot The adjuster her client and I quote   Shut your mouth handling this    I know about anyone else but I would not allow someone to talk to me that way much less someone I am paying to represent me Her client my father and myself are all very VERY displeased and that is an understatement with the service we have received from this adjuster I never knew that you were allowed to go AGAINST the police report clearly stating facts from a police officer as an adjuster All around very displeased with the service I have been dealing with In dealing with the adjuster my father and I have received nothing but attitude resistance and unprofessionalism in dealing with clients  
 Had for over years but when we went aboard and returned our premiums almost doubled Never had an accident or changed to company They have no loyalty to customers at all We had a claim for a simple no fault that costs about years ago Our deductible is and always has been This company is not what it states to be at all military and veteran friendly They even want to see our driving record and aboard stuck it to us like a new customer Needless to say they were dropped and replaced  
 I had a small collision driving out from my parking space and hitting the other on the road It was my fault the bumper went off I took my to the auto body shop and then I was waiting three weeks for the damage estimation In addition the estimator contact with us took the bumper and literally disappeared I was calling Nationwide Inspections they were responsible for the estimation every single day saying the same story and every single day they promised me to have the estimation next day It took them three weeks to do something Then I was by that I try asking for rental reimbursement even if I have it in my cause the waiting time was sooo long And of course at the end screwed us up saying that not possible switching to different company cause want to think what would happen if the accident was more serious  
Took weeks to approve supplement for body shop causing me to run out of time on my rental I ended up paying out of pocket Took calls to a real person Kept voicemail & unreturned phone calls switching companies never use them again 
 Had a claim for broken skylights on my RV being working with a rep for about days When an offer was made for the total loss found it to be about dollars lower than the value of the RV When I questioned about the claims process and asked for in writing their resources to base their offer for the Total Loss Was that they look at what has sold in my area in the last days within miles To an offer What happened to NADA value for the RV and options Does that seem fair since due to market ups and downs  
 Been with for years Had an accident in my fault Filed a claim and everything was taken care of perfectly Had an accident in May of this year had a police report stating the other driver insured by Esurance was at fault Claim went into arbitration was strung along being the chances of my deductible back looked good since there was a police report months later I a letter stating that was closing the file on my claim since neither or ESURANCE failed to prove liability Rates are great but pay more to company that does their job and looks out for their clients

 I recently had the misfortune of a minor accident after + years of driving accident free I was backing out of my driveway and made it halfway into the street when driver across the street slammed her back into mine I am insured with she is insured with Allstate Upon exiting our she admitted fault stating   I am so sorry I look around each way and I see you there    Unfortunately I was not in the mindset to record the conversation She also stated   I see any damage on my We exchange policies in case    I immediately called Allstate which filed my claim within minutes of the accident Allstate called the other driver's mother the primary policyholder the next day who was likely unaware of the incident Then a retaliatory claim came my way through I provided recorded statements to both Allstate and and did not do anything whatsoever Allstate took a recorded statement sent me to an adjuster inspection and I am still awaiting their response immediately me after the recorded statement that there was nothing they do for me They the other driver's statement full of lies was contradictory to mine and they could do nothing further Seems like a shoddy investigation and fault determination all around I most certainly be switching my carrier and filing a lawsuit against the liar driver  
 I have been a for over years since I first my drivers license all of my have had full coverage on them over the years I recently put in a claim because my was stolen and they that while they reviewed my claim they would put me in a rental It took them less than a week to   review   my claim where they stated that I would have to go after the party that stole my and that they would NOT pay my claim and I could no longer covered for a rental I asked the adjuster why they cover my rental for weeks while I look for a especially since I have been paying for over years She   you cancel your policy if not satisfied   then she proceeded to transfer me to a separate department that me that I cancel by phone but I had to email fax or mail them in writing that I wanted to cancel Not a single person tried to me to keep my service with Then on top of that I had asked for paperwork to be sent to me a week ago for my case and wanted to double check if it had been sent and I found out that they had never sent it at all Do not go with they take loyalty seriously and at the end of the day are after money we're all a number to them  
 I've always enjoyed ad campaigns and even had a policy with for a few years As a customer holding a policy I never encountered bad service and aside from annoying hold times on their phone lines my experience with was adequate THAT was before I had to file a claim against In April of this year I was involved in a accident that was not my fault I was sitting at a red light and had been for over a minute It was rush hour and I was the last in a line of about ten waiting for the light to change It was a beautiful afternoon and I had the convertible top down I did not see or hear it coming and literally did not know what had hit me Suddenly I was jammed into the steering wheel ears ringing head burning the world was black for a moment then fuzzy and lastly confusing and terrifying I had been rear ended by a distracted driver in a Land Cruiser She was texting She never even hit her brakes She was covered by I spare you the details of my injuries they are not the subject of this narrative anyway What I want to impress upon you all is the horror that I encountered while trying to resolve my claim with this company has done everything in their power to minimize my injuries They have condescended my husband during on conversations They have purposely left documents and figures out of their settlement offers They have offered us a ridiculously low amount only I had + in medical bills The offer came after months of pain suffering and evasion from this horrendous agency Each time we ask to speak with a supervisor we are connected with an individual even less professional and more offensive than the before him has intentionally neglected to give us guidance on how to proceed with settlement They even once closed our case without notification in hopes that we would simply disappear They have done everything in their power to avoid having to make reparations for the injuries that I received at the hands of their reckless client And it has been a total nightmare I recently heard a saying that those who work to keep you focused on your measly pile of crumbs only want you to forget who is running away with the whole cake I think of a more fitting way to describe this company or this situation is a soulless corporate machine that does not value me as a human being I feel totally insulted violated and offended by this entire ordeal And I feel helpless I honestly cannot believe how little thinks of the people who are injured by those they insure It is reflected in the attitude and words of every individual that I have encountered in their claims department ashamed that I was ever associated with this company and regret every penny I ever paid them for coverage I pray to God that the day that I finally settle on this claim be the last I ever have to deal with this godless agency Please like share and spread the word

 Just like to say WTG been a client for over a decade and for the first time I actually had a claim What did your claims adjusters do me that the guy who was to T Bone me and ran me off the road was not responsible for the small amount of damage to my because I was a good enough driver to not allow him to hit me So even though his had already claimed responsibility your adjuster them   no all good we this   and then charged me my deductible because it was a    nd accident and completely my fault    As if that enough while moving my to repaired from the    nd accident   the towing company damaged my rims and yet adjuster tells me that it is a    rd accident and you'll have to pay the deductible again to them fixed    THEN I a phone call that I may be liable for an accident on a I owned in mos because it used to be on my policy even though the accident was days ago and nowhere on my policy Let's not forget the first adjuster telling me that my medical was reimbursable then a month later after care being that there is no way to prove this is from the supposed    nd accident   so not to cover it Once this mess is dealt with I NO LONGER BE A client  
 Jennelle called to verify info on my policy She was racist for my Spanish accent she was rude and did not answer my questions All they want is to raise the policy and then if you ever into an accident they make up millions excuses to not pay you This people is careless and unprofessional  
 I was in a   fender Bender   on For reasons I cannot understand the accidents was ruled my fault The guy hit from behind I disputed the police report with Fort Worth because it has statements I never stated or the other party for that fact The old man who hit me remember hitting me He actually turned into a local restaurant park and went to have breakfast The officer had to go him and bring him out The other party he hit a pole and not me At that point I was upset and I immediately filed a claim with my When the Police report came a few days later I saw what the officer put and pretty much lost it He I moved over into his lane and caused the accident Not sure where or why he that idea because I was slowing down at a red light long after changing lanes and was hit from behind After all that I filed a complaint on the officer since I had   proof in pudding   the cop was stupid He had started sending me text messages that started off saying   He remember hitting you but he thought he hit a pole    The next few message were not pertaining to the accident They were personal and inappropriate I took this as retaliation When I shot him down he changed the report Well I showed my proof text messages and an investigation was started I was a few days later that they prove the report was wrong and had to stay as is but the officer has been reprimanded Total BS During the investigation internal affairs spoke with the other party and they did find out that he recently had a stroke and it affects his memory motor skills and time reaction REALLY And I am at fault This guy needs a medical suspension on his Driver’s License and he needs to stay off the road He corroborated the police report not because what happened but it is what he was to say by his company or what he read I think he went with it So fixes his almost damage and rental fees They call me to let me know I thank them for   fighting for me   Stand up bang up job guys They knew I disputed I ask them When are y’all to fix my bumper They replied   When you take it to a shop    They gave me a few places and me that I would need to leave my for days in the shop but I have rental coverage a single mom Rental no for up to days deductible NOT HAPPENING QUICKLY I have to save and prepare for that expense I explained to claims adjuster that I would have to figure something out I pay per month I had a tickets years ago no accidents and I am so high Thought I would be covered for a rental at that price Any who I took my to Service King and they popped my bumper in total I explained the situation and he is the worst Change ASAP But he would help me out I was also hurting for a few days after the accident but I went to the doctor and paid for that out of pocket too Today a new claims adjuster called to talk to me and let me know they settled all claims I laughed and   Oh did you because I pay damn near a month but yet I had to pay out pocket for everything because made it impossible for me to afford all the deductibles doctor fees rental fees etc    My bumper still has damage paint only but I live with that and I tell my doctor’s office I was in an accident because I would have had to pay the full amount to see the doctor not my co pay I am not sure how works but I am done They paid for nothing on my end yet I am still paying per month drafted out of my account They hesitate to take my money Makes it impossible to afford repairs and fight for you Never again THANKS FOR NOTHING  
 I was in a accident about years ago in which a owned ran a red light and hit my Toyota runner mainly in the front end paid for the damages + to my and that I had a   lifetime warranty   on the repairs Within months the front door panels had started to come loose I took the to the Toyota dealer and was that the repair was done sub par and the whole panels would need to be replaced I have attempted to contact service reps multiple times never someone on the phone always leaving messages and never a response I still have the loose door panels Over a year ago I started noticing that the paint on the front hood of the as well as along the side where the repair company had to re paint is peeling off and the underlying metal is rusting Apparently they did an inferior job of painting as well I am still unable to a response from anyone At this point the value of my has dropped immensely And my anger at this horrible company has increased immensely time I contacted the main number and a person located in my very same town I asked him how I could contact someone He gave me the phone number for the woman in charge of my service agreement even me where she was located in town I suggested that I could go down and see her in person He she was in a back office and I would not be allowed in to see her and she would definitely not come out to see me What I do I love this but it looks so BAD now All because someone possibly a employee ran a red light As if all the problems with my disrepair are not enough when I decided to change to a different company the new company ran some sort of internet search on my driving history and revealed to me that had listed the accident as being MY fault Never me But I imagine they raised my rates And when I would call to inquire about why my rates were up this was never mentioned Thanks to the person at the new company I was able to contact and them to correct the internet record But not without a fight  
 I was using the app to a   quote   on adding a driver to my policy It gives options add a driver now or a quote I selected a quote I went through the whole process and at the end it say   save your quote    I did this and it added the driver When I called to it removed they me their policy to add anyone who falls within the guidelines of the questions they ask In order to remove the driver I would have to proof that they have with someone else Very shady and very disappointing  
 My was vandalized July th I reached out to for assistance Rep Ramiza ** assisted me I know I have a deductible of Ramiza ** informed me if I used an auto shop directly affiliated with I would not be held responsible for the payout of the deductible That was a lie blatant Whether I chose a Express repair or the local neighborhood auto shop still responsible for the deductible I definitely learned this today when the auto adjuster me   no money no    I have been on the phone all day with reps Supv Even an exec supv I have no No transportation Left stranded in the street with my year old son Stroller seat No was helpful I cancel the because then I incur dmv fees for the plates really at a loss and all because the rep Ramiza ** misinformed me and lied taking this all the way to the top When all is and done finished with forever  
 Rude people on the phone They rejected me and tell me why when all I have is a speeding ticket for miles per hour over and then the representative laughed at me I was very offended and I had a large commercial policy with them that I not be using with them anymore  
 After years with and NO accidents or tickets I let my auto lapse past the due date and went with Progressive as they were less expensive I figured would drop me since I did not pay the bill Then I finally did call to cancel ten days after the past due date in case They sent me a bill for nearly claiming I owed them for the time I had with them and did not pay They if I could prove I had other during that period drop the charge I sent them the new declarations page from Progressive as proof and they immediately turned my account over to collections Now threatening letters from the collection agent and they are calling my house for a lousy is the WORST company never experienced such poor customer service I am fortunate I never had to file a claim with this company If I ever see that stupid lizard from their very expensive Madison Avenue commercials feed him to the birds  
 I had an appointment to have my auto repaired as determined that there was equal fault in incident I had small damage to my Lincoln Navigator I was by the adjuster that they give me an idea how long it would take to repair the damage and that it could even be longer than a week I was that they COULD have to order a new fender or bumper for my OLDER model navigator with miles so I would have to pay for my own rental while my drivable barely noticeable damaged sat on their lot while they ordered a part and I pay for a rental to have the repairs This is unacceptable I also have a problem with ProBody collision in Miami that makes you go to for their repairs Also the adjuster   Alma   who behaved and acted so unprofessional that I almost thought she was a teenager Beware as my is still unrepaired as they are not in a hurry to help me the work done My accident was July and it is August st month already I be looking for other as soon as this is resolved  
 I'm an IT professional with an income of over k annually However I did not arrive at this career using the traditional route of a year education only two years I had two insured with for nearly years and not asked about education level I asked for a quote on my home this month I was asked my level of education to obtain a better discount I immediately became angry by the unfairness of this for myself and all others who do not obtain the best rates based on a stereotype that a year education makes for a better customer How many respectable hardworking people who could not afford a college education are being penalized with higher rates from they have enough struggles w o being profiled as a   less than adequate   customer based on perceived intelligence and reliability I was so angry I cancelled the two with and switched to State Farm within the same hour State Farm did NOT ask me about my education level The charming has leadership behind him who should be ashamed of this level of discrimination Does Warren Buffett as the owner of support these practices I understood that integrity was of the utmost importance to Warren and preached to his Berkshire Hathaway companies Discrimination is not integrity in my book  
 Looking to insure my while I am teaching abroad a quote for the state minimums for the online and it looked good To confirm explained my situation clearly with in email to verify saying   I be an expat teaching abroad in China but I need to leave my here at my parents' house in Massachusetts parked in their driveway    stating   be come for about months year    responded saying   While you are away you be able to keep your in a storage plan The storage plan comes at a lower cost than your traditional auto policy as it only carries comprehensive and collision coverage Once you are a policyholder you be able to start your storage plan by contacting a Customer Service Agent at    Called to the plan re explained the same thing and they me my situation meant I did not have custody of the and they would not offer me I asked them what their standard was for # months at the permanent residence per year to meet the   custody   qualification as I be in the US for probably months out of the year The representative could give me no straight answer but kept repeating   you do not have custody of the    When I asked him why the representative who emailed me me I was eligible for the policy all he would say is   You typically a quote online not through email    I responded that I did both and   Okay well you do not meet our requirements to have custody of the and need to look elsewhere    not answering my questions He then quickly me off the phone without allowing me any recourse or explanation of their specific policies or why the representatives were giving me different information I am extremely dissatisfied with customer service The man on the phone basically me that there were no options for me with when their emails other options were available They did not honor their word  
Was hit by a insured They are now denying my medical claims as they feel I was hit at a fast enough speed to be injured My guess is they deny everyone and hope they an attorney sure their insured are paying this high lost of litigation TERRIBLE COMPANY So glad always chosen AAA 
 My daughter is a customer of auto Recently she was involved in an auto accident which at the time of the accident was determine not to her fault She was traveling through a green light and turned left into the side of her When it was time for statements the opposite party lied and she ran a red light claimed it to be a at fault claim Both parties are customers The other party has liability and collision and my daughter having only liability simply took the other parties word This results in only having to fix They did not do any investigation of the damage no site investigation nothing My daughter now has a totaled without any assistance from If the other party had not been a customer would they have performed and proper investigation Their policy states clearly on their website what they do in the case there is a conflict in statements They did nothing If they would have taken the time to look at my daughter's they have seen it was clear he ran into the side of her not an expert but I am fairly certain impossible to run into with the side of yours Very disappointed that did the very least possible amount they could do We are pleased that she was safe and her baby yet to be is ok as well I wonder if she had any medical concerns and we pray that there be down the line that may have taken a more responsible approach to an investigation into matter Shame on you And you wonder why people are displeased when companies are involved I am covered by Allstate and confident they would have handled this in a professional manner This is why the premier providers are premier  
My was involved in an accident on The driver who was driving my was Sandra ** Sandra was driving my and the driver of the other insured by was behind my When my went to make a right turn the driver of the failed to slow down and swerved to miss my causing her to hit the side of my and a pole This ticket issued to the driver clearly states the exact accident that happen at the time is discrimination because the driver who was driving my is Hispanic and could not speak English I have been informed by that it was at both cars' fault and they would not fix my I am very upset at the discrimination of this company and that they have took side with their driver I have attorney working on the case due to the driver at being at fault and not wanting to repair my claims because my driver did not see the driver because she was behind my that both are at fault As we all know we have control of what the behind does This is very upsetting that I am having to go through this After all the evidence it was the driver was at fault The lady working my case was very rude I called her to ask for a recorded statement that the person driving my had made and she she needed to talk to the driver and I give the phone her and she asked for someone who spoke Spanish so the claim assistant Lelonie Sandra to give the phone back and she stated that she would sent the info out in the mail The next day she called Sandra wanted to ask her again if she wanted the statements sent out I feel a large amount of discrimination on behalf of 
 My wife was stopped at a stop sign their client was on the phone and hit her from behind but own people to fix and wants to pay % when their clients fault What the hell is trying to pull So for all you drivers that want try to screw other drivers when their fault answer GET hear and so far found they are the BEST  
 The adjuster was not professional present during initial file for damages nor did he inspect my when it was supposed to have been completed The repair shop nor cared I wrote to the main office and still have received no reply is the worst in the business  
I called the automated line to change my billing info because I had closed my old banking account sent payment request to my old bank anyway then charged me the returned check fee Then me if they refunded the fee that would be a rebate and rebates are illegal per very rude sup Katie I then looked up the word rebate only to find out that rebates are not illegal 
Very very rude investigator cancel my policy as soon as this awful experience is over with Never go with 
I received a renewal for my auto policy which I have had for ten years with In Feb it was renewed for for six months My renewal for Aug is for for six months I called to ask about about this and was that had they had to pay out a lot of claims My part of that was a road side service It is still the same that I am insuring with the same usage and I have a clean record I would like to a % raise at work also I am mad 
 My son was entering the apartment parking lot when a rammed him head on The had failed to stop at a stop sign They exchanged information I received a notification from that it was not their client's fault Their client admitted fault and he was on his father's policy I have called left emails and sent letters not reply The damage to my is in the range I am very very upset Not all companies are crooked like this  
 Was looking for LOVED YEARS AGO Now not only did the agent flat out lie about who does and need to be placed on my policy obviously upselling but apparently has now decided that they are only to insure NO RISK DRIVERS as if anyone knows what that means As soon as the agent labeled me a DRIVER AT RISK HE HUNG UP ON ME If I offended yet I was by that point I have had ticket my entire life over years ago and never been in an accident or needed to file a claim MODEL CITIZEN HERE They me to   call again in months   when I was less of a   risk    I called Progressive and guess what a bang up deal on and even added renter's at a month Who could pass that up right If you are looking for an company that stand by your side during the bad and good times PROGRESSIVE is your place Also notice that closed their Google+ page because people were starting to leave star reviews an observation Looks like an employee typed in star review the same date the Google+ page was shut down It is now listed as   permanently out of business   when it should be listed as   we want you to know that people hate our company and why by reading our awful reviews    For those of you that are thrilled with the company good for you I was there once myself But apparently a ticket years ago makes me a   risk   and they refuse to insure me btw the ticket was for miles over the speed limit FIVE MILES I would have fought it but I had moved to a different state so I sent them the payment At this point glad I the ticket we live in a perfect world and companies that act like your friend LIKE PROGRESSIVE beats companies that act like a dollar sign  
 is good at giving low estimates Then when you sign up and pay they tell you there is an incident on your record an incident that I already claimed Then they tried to tell me an incident years ago on my daughter who lived in state was added to my record The accident was in her name and with her and it was a no fault yet they once again raised my rate I dumped them as they thought I would stay with them now that they had me past my renewal date BUYER BEWARE be fooled by low estimates I would not use 
 My son had this ** company and was killed by a drunk driver Called this company and requested a refund of the premium he had paid in advance Rep stated that they required the customer to request the refund At the time my son was in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit unable to communicate verbally as he was intubated and on a ventilator so he could breathe Rep was advised of this and nonchalantly replied that at his earliest convenience my son would have to request the refund Ultimately when my son passed away we again contacted this ** company and requested a refund due to my son's passing and was that they cannot issue a refund without his consent They did not ask for a death certificate nor did they give their condolences or ask what they could do They simply   nope nothing we can will do    my loss… This company and their reptilian counterpart can simply jump off a high cliff  
 Other party hit my in a parking lot and left a note so I could contact him Claim went to directed me to their claims facility body shop I found out they wanted to do   spot repairs   on my brand new < mi They also did not want to pay for the rental of a similar to mine telling me that it was my expense if I wanted to do so I learned I could take my anywhere I wanted to When I the guy I was to take the elsewhere he may not pay if the bill was more than their estimate owned the body shop and the rental office was in the office also they would not pay for the rental while at shop They acted like they had the authority to dictate how this third party claim would be handled and what should be paid according to their perspective WELL I learned what they did is called   steering   Internet is full of info regarding this unethical practice employed by an company to a claimant to take their to a facility where control costs for their best interests I was concerned about   my   best interests Every contact with resulted in a promise of action or a return call that never happened has refused to pay our repair bill and offered what they estimated in their shop A difference of I am forced to file suit in Small Claims Court against the policyholder to recover the full amount of the loss  
I into my first accident about yr ago & with for over yrs They handled the claim quickly but when I tried to file a claim for hail damage they asked me to see an adjuster I did and he there was no damage I let them know I had a quote for a paint job and wanted to make sure all was ok I it painted but I tried to file an erroneous claim and canceled collision coverage for my whole family And now they reduced our liability coverage and sent us all to some other sister company when the renewal comes up in September I paid my bill in full within the first months and full coverage for cheap This company has no loyalty to their customers They are great you need or use them They paid me less than for my in over years while I paid full coverage premiums the whole time with no accidents and only ticket BAD BAD BAD company 
 So I started a policy as primary and put my parents on as favor being it was cheaper for driver discounts and such days later they had dropped my coverage and was not notified whatsoever but drop my parents not possible But the info that was provided to the DMV So no notice for months that I had no coverage but was paying for it So I found a better deal changed companies months after I pulled over due to an expired registration No biggie my own fault Continue to renew my registration and a   stop   on my Turns out my registration was suspended and they still had on file although I had had them in months months unknowingly So now I have to pay for my registration Thanks  
 I recently made the switch from Esurance to on July nd The reason being is that quoted me a rate of for six months On July th I received an email telling me that my premium is actually to be They stated the reason for the change was an accident was not reported Even though I did report the accident and the sales rep John ** he found that accident in the system and quoted me the even with the accident I believe there should be a recording Now days later that changes There is nowhere in my emails that they sent where they say that the original quoted is subject to change or did the sales rep ever inform me that the could change I would have never made the switch if this quote was given to me To me this is very similar to a bait and switch  
 I was considering leasing a new but was unsure if I could afford the and the To be sure I called up from the dealership gave them all necessary information about I was considering and they gave me a monthly price quote of This was surprising and I mentioned this to rep that that was an even lower price than the liability I was currently paying with on an old I had at the time which was The associate verified that my rate would indeed be mth for the new Because of this I purchased and was shocked when my first bill of came in the mail I spoke to representative from and they managed to reduce the policy by mth of which I am appreciative but that change the fact that I would have NOT purchased this if this was the monthly payment since we are a income household I am now stuck with this issue for the next three years until my lease is up When I called to ask for help in this matter I was I could have gone online and did the quote myself to make sure that the info I was was correct I have been a customer of for over years and never thought I would have to double check them By the way this is after the fact that I pulled over and received a ticket last month for a lapse of even though I have been paying the bill every month They apologized for this mistake but I still have to appear in court for this ticket I never use again after these two experiences and I now have to figure out how to bring an additional mth to our household to cover this scam of a bill every month  
 I fell for their commercials that state repeatedly that    minutes save you % on insurance   HA When I the quote I nearly fainted I asked them if that was for a year or more because their ridiculous quote was ten times what everyone else quoted This company and their commercials are a joke Save yourself a ton of money and buy a policy with Shelter like I did  
 I called to   get a quote   for my daughter mind you had this auto ins for yrs Well they tacked her onto my policy without my permission Then they me my rate was ** dollars They did not ask if I wanted to add her but the FACT THAT she even live with me This was outrageous I asked them to take her off and they in turn me I NEEDED to prove she living here They take her off So I was forced to CANCEL my policy and go with some other I hate the fact they think they do whatever and then you HAVE TO PROVE yourself This is BS I recommend to anyone Stay clear of those money hungry asses  
 Months ago I joined with and from the minute I called them to start service I was given the runaround and misled as well as rude service First the female agent me a much lower quote and down payment price She also me that I should sign up for recurring payments I hesitated because my ssi is deposited on the first of every month and it was a few days before then I mentioned that to her and she clearly stated to me that it was no big deal sign into my account and change the dates for the payment to be taken out of my account so I agreed and signed up for recurring payments My original monthly payments were only a month when I first joined Then after my ticket for non registration the agent me it would hike my rates up almost a month for at least a few years Wow So the agent me my rate was now a month I should've ran the other direction But I I stayed for about four months I rid of my Went online to cancel my policy and everything seemed to have went ok and then I online before the next scheduled payment to be certain they take out my payment and it was bad It me I cancel in big red words Were not there the prior month when I tried to cancel and also had my card info still even after I cancelled erased deleted my payment info and it was all back I believe it Then I had very rude service with agent after I called and they refused me my case notes and me I needed an attorney and took my payment out on my account Knowing agreeing with it So I am mad and never using again and I am telling everyone I know what my experience was with them  
 My experience with was great until the shop they referred me to damaged my After that both the shop and denied all damages and has left me holding the bill should not refer policyholders to a shop that performs faulty work ESPECIALLY if they are unwilling to stand behind their customer with an A+ driving record and no claims  
 I reported my stolen The representative would not process the information unless she spoke with the detective who was assigned to the case personally to which I might add worked night shift So it was hard for the two to communicate due to representative off at pm She would not accept the police report nor would she accept any faxed information from the police department This was time consuming Further a month later they still charged me for two even though was reported stolen My question to them was why I would have to notify once more to take the off the policy Why this information generated and why I advised of procedure Their ans was   I know My apologies and what else I do for you    
I was rear ended by a gentleman who is insured with After filing my complaint and taking my to the collision center I was very displeased with the service The issues that occurred as a result of my accident was damage to the rear of my and my radio The adjuster stated that he could fix the rear but could not fix the radio because it was highly unlikely that it stop displaying properly as a result of the accident He asked that I take my to the make's dealership and an estimate and information stating that the radio display is no longer working as a result of the accident I did exactly what he me and then he backs out and says that the dealership did not give them enough evidence which they did and that they not fix my display screen I NEVER EVER in my life deal with They are a horrible company and I would recommend any other company I have to now drive around with my display no longer working because some smart person decided to rear end me while he was texting Thanks a lot 
 Had a family policy for years mother on the policy gets into her first and only accident when she felt her steering wheel lock on the highway She broke her pinky finger and totaled but hit This happened in June of Our family policy renewed in August and our premium went up a couple hundred for the next months year with the accident notation on the policy A full year later no other accidents tickets they send a letter nearly dropping her from our policy I was our rate increase over nearly double the original rate or we exclude her from our policy Their only explanation was that this last year they changed their   rate system   and that she lost her good driver discount due to   bodily injury    I was ensured she was the best rate If I am bodily injury is considered a    point   ding then why did it show as point for a full year only to increase to a year after Also why would a rate change a full year later show an increase of almost % Makes more sense to charge higher early on very disappointed thought was much better  
 I recently took auto from on I had a toyota corolla L on it the day I brought and I paid approximately for month and purchased my auto quote for At that time my collision was deductible Later on I changed the on the same policy number calling the customer service representative by phone They suddenly raised it to approximately and when I asked them to reduce my billing cycle payments he suggested me to raise my deductible as claimed it would definitely lower my monthly payments so I agreed but he immediately increased my deductible to a thousand dollars and did not resume my monthly billing cycle I thought it would be effective from the next billing cycle but unfortunately was effective from the same day In such a way I was tricked and I had an argument from the sales manager that the sales person was right and my fault that I did not check my deductibles the next day But my unfortunate situation was I met the accident the very next day and when I took it for the repair store I then came to know that I my deductible raised to a And my monthly payments also went high I had to call back to customer service and make sure my prices were as same or at least be close to when I first brought the policy And had to go through all the tension each time by calling in customer service to check my status whether they have granted my claim to a deductible which they Please help  
 Our was hit by a insured driver Police report and all witnesses to accident stated it was percent the insured driver's fault ** is stating that their driver is only percent responsible for the accident because from their viewpoint some place in Texas not in Kansas they see that we could have stopped in time to avoid a collision Watch out people who are on the road with drivers their does not pay for accidents I would never encourage anyone to  
 They keep increasing premium every months When you ask them why they send you   pre compiled   auto reply I wonder if they lure in clients from other companies with a low premium rate and then deceive them increasing premium every months  
 Filed a claim insured through I was in a accident in Philly The insured though lied about the accident I provided police report have video pictures witnesses showing the man tried to pass unlawfully on my right causing me to collide with him on a right turn This driver came up behind me while I was stopped at a Burger King exit He drove up on the lawn to on my right side and continued to turn right when I was also turning right Hello the violations are clear about passing on right in every state driver's manual The results my is totaled I contact my his which is you guessed it take your money raise your rates refuse to pay claims for any or no reason They are the worst company ever They are known for bad dishonest business practices Which why I would not ever buy a policy through this company MR BUFFETT RICH RIPPING HARD WORKING PEOPLE OFF Filing a claim with this company is a automatic fight Be prepared to file a lawsuit to paid not pay unless a court order forces them to pay If you have to file a claim with this company your lawsuit filed at the same time to save you time and money Do not expect them to pay no matter what because they are to deny deny deny No matter what you have to prove you are a victim of the bad drivers insured by

 My was totaled in an accident with a customer The agent tried to head off my company State Farm Their agent called and offered about dollars under the NADA value for my They based this claim on every piece of junk they could dig up that was similar to my in make model and mileage  
 Began the process back in Canada before arriving North Carolina to make sure gets everything they need for legitimate They insured me within minutes for an insanely low rate of for months   Recommended   I abstract Canadian driving record so they offer lower rates in the future Couple months later slapped with bill for not providing abstract Every agent I spoke to had a different story Finally supervisor involved who found out he could request abstract through his office Promised refund after abstract was received When I checked in a month later they still it so supervisor authorized refund of even without the document Also found out they cancelled my collision so I was driving around without that Upon renewal new rate came back at for same Agent explained it was because collision was added this time BUT I ALREADY HAD COLLISION the first time around until they cancelled it Totally incompetent inexperienced and painfully dumb staff months of stress  
 My flooded on Claim still not settled DID call many time but no luck Insured with for long time this first time claimed filed Thinking to switch company Very disappointed

I had for about a year I recently had a auto accident and filed a claim with I called to tell to cancel the so that I did not pay for a that was involved in a auto accident This company cancelled my policy for a month prior to the accident on purpose so that did not have to pay for the damages The agent never me that she was to cancel the policy and make it days before the accident This company SUCKS 
 Ok I off the phone with a customer service rep because my wife noticed that our coverage is up My daughter had an accident a while ago and it has no effect on our account anymore according to the rep Their reason for this increase is that they are reviewing the accounts in California and are rewriting the accounts Really there is nothing causing a reason for an increase except it is When is the government to really protect people from company greed  
 A insured driver pulled out from a stop sign and T boned me on passenger side door forcing my to also hit a median sign on driver side He was cited for failure to yield to a through highway The driver seemed pretty straight to me admitted fault even coming up to my window when the police were done to again say   I'm sorry it was an accident I do it on purpose    The rep claims he was that their driver was stopped I   Yeah stopped at the stop sign then pulled out and hit me    He denied the liability Then a few weeks later my agent again contacts them the an ** him that his driver claims I lost control and hit his stopped I was a lane away from him he crossed lane to hit me and HE ended up stopped in the turning lane from the other opposite direction side physically impossible My agent confronts him with being cited for failure to yield and ** claimed that his client the officer misunderstood him and he was fighting the ticket This is mid late March and the driver had already PAID his ticket in early mid February a week or so after the accident OBVIOUSLY a lie Posted the situation on Facebook page and a response the 'higher up' rep she had the accident report which my agent had faxed to them in front of her even googled up the intersection so she could see it and   I think pretty clear you were on a through street and he had a stop sign I think this needs to be reversed    At this point I thought they would actually act in good faith I was SO very wrong After months of anguish I find out that is still not accepting their responsibility by denying liability In my honest opinion is guilty of fraudulent practices If you have them as an company and have an at fault accident you almost certainly dragged into court being sued Spread the warning I be filing a complaint with the commission and attorney general's office regarding this  
 I have policies with ALL BEING CANCELLED This company is nice until they have to pay a claim Been hung up on been lied to too Reporting this matter to the State of Massachusetts  
Piece of crap company I downloaded the app to make paying easier Instead I made my payment and was my next due date A week later I was sent a letter saying that I owed half of the payment and my service was stopped Checked my card that I made the payment with and there was no money on it AWESOME Thanks guys Now I have a credit collection service billing me go with this company unless you want money stolen from you and bad credit 
 I was with for a few years I switched because they surprisingly gave me a better rate I used to call in my payments but when that became inconvenience I signed up for the online account and started making my payments through there I originally paid with a debit card at point I had to cancel my debit card due to fraudulent charges and I used my bank account for a payment I was requested to enroll in automatic payments in order to use my bank account thinking oh how convenient it withdraw the last day of every month WRONG After through all of the frustration of a new debit card due to fraudulent charges I made a payment to thinking logically that hey if they receive the payment a few days prior to the due day they not withdraw funds from my account Since obviously they withdraw the funds until the day due boy was I in for a headache I made the payment days prior to the due date and the day they withdraw funds from the account took the payment same day from my bank The website stated on the screen when I made the payment that my account reflect the payment and that the payment post the same day and that my account had been satisfied days later attempted to withdraw the payment from my account not only time but times costing me in return fee's for an NSF payment ON TOP OF THAT charged me a fee for NSF payment EVEN THOUGH THEY RECEIVED THEIR PAYMENT DAYS AGO I talked to customer service they   well we sent an automated email the same day you made a payment letting you know we would be withdrawing the funds on such and such date    Which means they actually request the payment from your bank days before even due and you cannot stop the payment unless you go through your bank and pay a stop payment fee Needless to say when the customer service rep that they would not take responsibility for any fees I was charged from the bank I called Progressive and they matched their rate and on top of that they have a more logical process they process the payment the day due and if you pay before they do not process a payment to your account even if enrolled in automatic pay The representative also gave me false information she stated I would be receiving a refund check of I only received a check for dollars I called to inquire about the amount and they they had to remove some of the refund due to the returned payment EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PAID DAYS IN ADVANCE AND STILL RAN THE PAYMENT THEY ALREADY RECEIVED sign up for automatic pay and I do not recommend as they do not take responsibility for this type of ignorance I am much happier with Progressive method of payments do not lack common sense If they receive my payment they be withdrawing the funds unlike who apparently care whether or not they cost you money they continue to take more from you even after making such an avoidable mistake Their system should not say   your account reflect your payment and has been satisfied   if they still send a payment to your bank even after already receiving it  
 I had progressive and I am paying so I called and made a quote with them and the agent on the phone   So    After we proceed and I was about pay he goes   Ok so to be dollars a month    I was like   What You gonna be including taxes   and then he goes   Yes but there was some miscommunication because someone put the use issue date of your license on and actually    a complete fraud and DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO HAVE THEIR AUTO WITH WORST EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  
  client lost control of their hit me in a head on collision I had a broken sternum shredded muscle from my chest to my back and ligaments are stretched in my back ribs My truck was a total loss + dollars they did pay that Then acted as though they wanted to compensate me fairly for injuries Do not believe it and do not speak to them Their client was charged and admitted fault They called me when I was heavily medicated after leaving the hospital and they could not pay for my truck until they interviewed me They want to gather information to use against you with no intention to compensate you fairly I lost weeks of work last year and physically feel years older I earned from per month last year first offered me for wages for pain and suffering and to pay my medical They then offered for wages I turned the claim over to an attorney thank God I did not settle for what I ask It has been months I think I have pain the rest of my life My attorney me my company charge me because they turn it over to a third party administrator to handle the medical claims they never mentioned that I was not looking for a big payday only to be treated fairly I have discovered their business model is to deny all they because only % fight I think it is wrong to try to collect or over collect against companies when there is no or little loss I understand why people want to punish them I was by two separate attorneys that is a top two offender for companies trying to out of claims  
 I went online to com to a quote for my son & husband’s The quote I was given was a month which is great but when I called to talk to a sales person because I needed to check on payment methods The sales guy quoted me a month I ask why the online quoted he we had a claim in September but tell me what the claim was other than it was a   no fault   if to penalize someone then you better have documents to back it up We have not had any claim since winter of and that was not with I would not recommend for anything  
 Claim number ** From the beginning of the claim process the process was difficult Not knowing who to talk to what part of the claim would be handled by whom We were not given valid information by representative to talk to the other and visa versa They were insensitive about our loss and treated us like we were liars After submitting the necessary receipts and invoices for our lost personal property and uploading photos the information was never retrieved and we were without the items and receipts and when I presented them with the property and receipts for a portion of the loss I was although it was their covered clients fault they to pay for our substantial property loss or my sons personal injury I believe because we are African American we were treated unjustly and disrespectfully like liars

Price quote did not reflect the advertised savings

 On at am I was rear ended by a drunk punk with no license and driving person's I had whiplash and an ac Heater vent popped out of the dashboard knocking out a tooth loosening another and damaging more But refuses to pay and I have grand right after the collision and grand if that runs out but adjusters refuse to pay They closed the case and are about to have the shock of the company's lifetime in business It is to cost them millions after I finished with serving them They lie Always ask what they do if there is an accident  
 We are insured with and we never make any claim from them even if we had accident for we know we have to pay a deductible Last May I had a bad accident and it involves a chain reaction for four I was rushed to the hospital and a police arrived handed me my driver's license and ask him if who's fault was it   he it was my fault   even though I receive a citation I admit I hit the in front of me for he did a sudden stopped I was observing the man that he was talking to the other drivers while on the scene I ask everybody if they are fine and after weeks I receive a letter that some drivers are making a claim some hired a lawyer and the guy I hit looks like he lives in his with his son because I saw household stuff in their trunk such as comforter pillows etc The other day we received a letter from informing us that we went over our coverage limit afraid charge us   financially   and   drop   us anyone suggest what action we do I have medical bills and E M T bills but we took care of it ourselves We decided not to add more claim from for we know the involve make claims What's the use of if they help you All they are only after of making money Where's the justice  
 I have been with for several years My premium is paid until June I found out that they cancelled my policy as of May because I did not send them some information they wanted I never any letters When I offered to give them information on phone they wont take it saying it has to be mailed They I have to drive without until it is reinstated How they do this and away with it I have no choice but to seek legal help  
 I have been for past years and keep on paying premium once every months but recently they charged me extra telling that they extended my premium coverage date without asking me And on calculating they had extended month and charged extra for a month I called to the customer service but keep on insisting me that that is due to extension of coverage period I never requested for extension and used to update every months Then now they raised my premium to for every month with minimum coverage at the state of Texas and with deductible I was not happy with them then started shopping around and found less for months premium keeping the same coverage Now I am feeling like I have been ripped off with for past several months  
 I enrolled my in plan They offered me an   installment   plan but did not tell me that there were additional charges I a bill months later for charges unrelated to my that I DID NOT APPROVE I felt they pushed me into a plan that they could charge me more for without telling the customers I spoke with a customer service representative in hopes to rectify the situation but they basically   sorry for the miscommunication nothing we do    And continued to charge me for this AGAIN very poor that would do this to their customers  
 I experienced a theft and had to change my bank account info as well as other companies I pay online were contacted the next business day that they needed to change the online bank account they make payment from The rep did not care and they would charge my account an extra and treat it as a returned check I froze my bank account on Sunday reopened at the same bank Monday morning notified that same Monday morning which was when they were trying to take out the automatic payment and screwed by as well as the people who broke in my home Everyone else I contacted regarding the new account was very nice and did not have any additional charges really does not care  
 I had a customer service rep hang up on me This is after asking why my rate had increased so drastically by more than % He   You lost the California Good Driver Discount   because I had gotten a ticket However he refused to give me the breakdown In other words I was asking for the specific amounts for why it had gone from to In other words Comprehensive collision etc He kept cutting me off and saying   Do you want given you the quote    I was politely saying   I need more information please    And then he hung up on me  
 I had a break down on a PDX bridge scary tow my I had to pay the tow guy Then my other breaks down on the side of the hwy and only covered miles for tow and charged me per mile after that when I was only miles from home and had to anticipate a hr wait time And I have full coverage No tickets no accidents I pay for what OTHER PEOPLE'S ACCIDENTS… SUCKS I NEVER GO SURE THEY’RE THE CHEAPEST you what you pay for  
 We have been a long time customer of and was very satisfied until this time when we had our repaired lately When we complained about the work the repair shop had done both the Adjuster ** and the repair shop technician ** had been ignoring us for the past month now giving us those promises to no avail Lately I was by the Adjuster that he cannot do anything about it when in FACT the technician had been promising me for a month that he do something about it When I the Adjuster about those promises he also made a promise to me that he call me back Been waiting for the call but no call for a week now Same thing PROMISES PROMISES PROMISES We are now very dissatisfied  
 I have three siblings we all had similar social security number and similar names When I registered this year April They automatically added my information under of my sibling's account From their account it shows my social security number and license ID number I called to make sure I have my own and my is not under theirs They made sure that I have my own HOWEVER my sibling's account still shows my information When the sibling try to call to remove the information they say it cannot be removed until the end of the When I call them to remove my personal information from their account they say I have no rights to do that because I am not their account holder According to this does not affect the amount of their bill but I do not feel safe for to be so irresponsible and made such a big mistake yet refuse to fix the mistake Imagine my personal information was not disclosed in my sibling's account but a total stranger  
I let my roommate put her monthly charges on my visa card because she have a credit card She pay me for her May installment and the payment go through on my visa card The rep she spoke with her that I blocked from taking the payment when that WAS NOT the case I have enough credit open on my account This lie from the rep caused my roommate to become so angry that she physically accosted me I have now blocked from my account and advise that no let them have access to their credit card for automatic payments 
 Okay so I a quote from and was reasonable They set up payment plan and down payment I my policy and cards in mail Now they change my policy without my consent I think that is against the law right You make changes to a contract that you already agreed to Needless to say the premium went up and made payments higher than originally agreed to Once this expires I be looking for a different company  
 On January a was too fast spun out and struck my house doing worth of damage It took me until March to finally reach a settlement figure with as they want to pay what the contractor bill was I fought and finally them to agree to That was March and I signed all the forms and faxed them in It is now June st and I still have my money The claims adjuster not return my calls and I have left messages on her supervisor's phone and he too not return my calls This has been a nightmare not sure I ever my money I am in law enforcement and based on my own experience and what I have seen over the years is of the worst companies to deal with  
I put my adult son on my policy last year but he no longer has a and has lost his driver's license suspended so he is not driving Meanwhile I must continue to pay a month for him on my policy because they not take him off my policy I have to prove that his license is no longer suspended which is ridiculous because it is suspended indefinitely I have never ever missed a payment and even referred many of my friends to them I am warning them now of what I am through I have never had a problem with dropping a or driver on any other policy I have ever had Ludicrous insure with 
 Vehicle was vandalized at the parking lot refused to pay and cancelled my policy It took them almost two months to   investigate   the claim and after   independent review   they came to the conclusion that I hit my own against the wall while driving sent me the refusal letter claiming fraud and misrepresentation Shortly after that they simply cancelled my policy without any notice is completely worthless Would never buy any product from them I am taking them to the small claim court and every penny back from them  
  has costed me my small business my job almost cost me my home All with a now months old baby They do not honor their premium policies nor the add ons they sale you My truck was stole and wrecked on I a rental and still fighting for payments to be paid They sold me accessories plan that they cover any of the upgrades I had done to my truck They return calls I have different people I have to call and none of them give me answers I text instead of phone calls Tired of the games Worst company ever had Well soon I lose everything from be accused of stealing my own truck to have everything worked so hard to get Taking and losing my small company I have ptsd and depression and uncontrollable panic attacks They do not care about their customers about their money and how they out of paying claims  
 On March th my wife and I purchased a brand new Honda Pilot SE added it to our current policy and drove it home with miles on the odometer when we left weeks later we drove the Pilot to FL with our kids to go visit their grandparents and a week after that drove it home hours from home I was stopped at a red light and BAM rearranged at mph by a young woman in a Scion XD Our brand new truck was weeks old and had miles on it and now drives completely different She bent something very important The State Trooper gave me the police report with the information of the young woman so I called to make a claim to no avail Her had been cancelled for non payment So I called to put the claim in under our Uninsured Underinsured coverage This is where it goes awry First sends an adjuster out days after the accident DAYS So being as that is my family's only and we feel comfortable driving it because it was reacting funny we go anywhere So finally this wet behind the ears adjuster shows up takes a minute stroll around my truck and estimates repairs to be and days worth of repairs after a reared collision at mph So then asks where I want to have it repaired On the recommendation of the selling dealer I ask for it to be brought to ABRA Auto Body and Glass in Charlotte NC Unaware that it is a EXPRESS facility arranges a tow truck to bring our Pilot to the bodyshop days later I call the adjuster to the status and that my claim is a COLLISION claim and upon repair I be accountable for a deductible not the deductible that is carried for Uninsured Underinsured claims to which I ask why and Im because Progressive the other woman previous ins company has not denied coverage yet So I go pay a visit to the shop Drove by it times because I had no idea it was a Express facility and there is NO ABRA sign anywhere on the property I ask the production manager why the concerns I had with my now leaking sunroof and drivability concerns were not addressed and he does not know I tell ABRA and the adjuster I want the frame of the truck put on the frame machine and checked and I want to be emailed the results So both parties agree and send the truck to ABRA's Concord NC location that has a frame machine Supposedly a frame measure is done and ** from ABRA's reception desk emails me a frame measure Upon receipt I notice not only is this not a frame measure from my truck not even from the same year It was someone else's frame measure from a completely different from years before that date I immediately call ** back who apologizes and resends me what she swears is the correct frame measure Oddly enough the owner information is blank the information is correct but the frame measure diagram and dimensions are IDENTICAL to the first email completely different of different years having the same exact dimensions after an accident Not to mention the dimensions made no sense considering the was hit in the rear and the dimensions on the side of the diagram were the inconsistent ones I was by ABRA and my adjuster that the frame was fine and within spec of the manufacturer and I was being   unreasonable   At that moment I knew something fishy was on I immediately called ABRA and them not to touch my truck and called and ORDERED my truck removed from ABRA's property and brought to Hendricks Collision a Honda ProFirst rated shop I had found online ABRA tried making me pay restocking fees on the parts they ordered before even doing the frame measure I refused and after threats of the BBB DMV and Commissioner they rescinded The next day tow truck brought my Pilot to Hendricks Collision Upon arrival ** from Hendricks immediately ordered frame measure on their frame machine same exact make model and software as ABRA's and to no surprise to either of us the frame WAS BENT The dimensions and diagram ABRA emailed me where MANUFACTURED to lead me to believe the frame was straight so could pay for ABRA to put REFURBISHED not OEM parts back on my truck and send it away Suddenly my estimate made its way to almost The rear section of the frame had been pushed up cm's on the drivers side and cm's on the passenger side knocking the rear doors and body out of alignment buckling the roof and quarter panels pushing the roof over to the pass side which is why the sunroof was leaking and pinching the pass front fender against the bumper cover tearing the paint back Because of the Pilot's ACE body structure all the side panels are manufactured as piece so the body absorbs as much shock as it to protect the people inside So now is fighting every supplement made by Hendricks to correctly fix my Pilot They even went as far as calling the roof buckles   factory defects   to which I called American Honda Motor Company who contacted I also wrote to the NC Commissioner NC Attorney General the BBB who are completely WORTHLESS they did nothing the Dept of Consumer Protection and my attorney for the accident I did receive injuries from the accident Then weeks into the claim on May th terminates my rental My Pilot is still taken apart at Hendricks Collision not even close to done and terminates my rental even before the days my is supposed to pay for and refuses to extend it So to teach them a lesson because not some broke man looking for a freebie I go out and purchase brand new Honda Pilot Now they have me strapped over a barrel Suddenly the theme changes NOW all of a sudden they want to speed up the repairs after they tried closing the claim because they   thought   I had traded in the first Pilot to purchase the nd while in pieces at the body shop Today Wednesday May th I a call from Hendricks Collision that my Pilot repairs are completed and my Pilot is ready for pickup weeks after the accident that was estimated at and days to repair And STILL has not changed the claim status from COLLISION coverage to UNINSURED UNDERINSURED and still expects a deductible I NEVER EVER give a minutes worth out my time and have already arranged with company I actively turn perspective customers away from them as long as I live like it is my JOB After sitting innocently at a red light and being put though HELL because of it  
 I was on the sidewalk riding my bike to work when a van came flying out a Tim Horton drive thru without looking and ran me and my bike over pinning my left foot under the driver side left wheel The driver was insured by At the time my medical coverage had lapsed and only way I could see about my injury I had to a referral from my primary doctor due to a change with coverage I had to wait nearly months and nursing myself back to normal nearly I tried to resolve a settlement agreement with of examiners and she me that she would send me a letter requesting my permission to my doctor's diagnosis Instead I received a letter saying that I would not receive any monetary award because she think me nearly being dead My injuries weren’t serious enough for her I was merely trying to work something out with the company that we both could agree upon but when there are employees that act like they are the ones settling with their own money then this company stay in court  
 On we were rear ended by someone who was represented by She rear ended a that had people in it of us had injuries and of the injured parties was returning to their country on a specific date Even after being that date twice the claims rep still called for his info AFTER this individual left the country Additionally after I settled my claim day later medical bill came in for Prior to submitting my bills I did call and confirm that this was the final bill and was unfortunately given the wrong information from the hospital When I called not only did they say they were unable to reopen the claim but that I was basically stuck with the bill When I called the California Department of they contradicted everything me even including the fact that is   unable   to reopen the claim and me that since the accident was % their fault I was not responsible for ANY medical bill I implore everyone dealing with them call your state's regulation department first not only engages in unfair business practices but dishonest ones as well  
Found better rates on my auto policy and switched to company and charged me cancellation fee never recommend to anyone 
 My wife's Softail Deluxe had suffered from wheel damage We had took it to Snake Harley Davidson in Twin Falls ID The shop in Twin did a great job keeping in contact with me and let me know what was on with the bike And that my adjuster wanted to use the damaged tire that was on my wife's Deluxe Snake Harley Davidson would not agree upon using the damaged tire I should not had to pay this much money for the bike so I had to purchase tire out of my own pocket This is why I pay so that I do not have to replace damaged part on our and motorcycles I think your adjuster did a very poor job of taking care of his customers I never use guys go again for anything I am now to cancel my and cancel my business with My deductible is only now my deductible My payment that I had to pay was so I my bike out I do not have an issue with paying a percentage of the pay rate I have an issue when I pay and I have to pay on top of that Where is the justice That is wrong Bad business  
Called roadside to have my suv which I pay extra for every month for ERS from Towed I HAD It towed to a shop but their price at the shop was not reasonable at all to fix a sensor So a few days later I call roadside service to have it towed back home THEY say no they only provide it per breakdown that I have to pay the tow percent out of pocket they would only tow if the problem was fixed I would obviously drive it home if it was fixed and not need a TOW How is that even ok So I pay extra money every month and even tow which I feel like I paid for already every month very angry at and their roadside not assisting when needed Thanks for nothing from your year customer 
 Two weeks ago my was looked at by an adjuster named ** My rim wheel brakes rotor tire the whole passenger front side was marred and AAA came out to pick me up The tow truck driver me he's seen this type of incident before He my caliper pin probably broke off resulting in everything else breaking all on own a GM problem that I should file with my ins company And it would be covered under comprehensive and my deductible would be about So that was Sat evening on my way to see the fight The next morning I called and the rep exactly that and I was comforted knowing we're all on the same page Then ** calls me Mon morning and tells me not covered He wear and tear I argued with him defending the definition of wear and tear and he would not change his stance unless I felt as though I   hit something    he did you hit something in the road I I know maybe it felt as though I did because my was shaking so bad but I know it happen so quickly like a was running over a series of small pot holes which exist on the fast lane of a freeway its well paved but in any event there was shaking I determine from what Now been two weeks later and his supervisor never returns my calls and he's still acting like an idiot claiming to have seen evidence on my wheel that suggest I hit a pot hole So as of today no and still waiting to hear back from him or them been over a week Every time I speak with him I cringe God help us is the pits this character several times why the differing in opinions and why would he lie to me and try and coerce me over the phone He hadn't even seen my He wiped the cold out his eye early morning called me and wear and tear Why the rep on the phone say that instead she covered and now he's trying to more money from me for a new tire Estimated at which pay because repairs are close to however been two weeks and I heard back from anyone So this is definitely a frustrating process and seeking help from the CA attorney general office for support not only for me but for every customer who's at the mercy of an incompetent claims adjuster and so forth  
 I would never recommend to anyone the worst customer service I have ever experienced To Whom It May Concern I recently had my cancelled with and the way in which it was handled was truly undeserved and without reason I have paid my premium on time every month I was also sent a letter stating that because of my clean driving record my was being lowered Wow that was great I left for Italy with my husband on February I am in Italy until September I decided to keep the full coverage on my and I also added driver so she could start my and drive it when I was gone to maintain the While I am gone the person that is looking after my is also checking my mail for me and living in my home Everyday she sends me a photocopy of any important mail that I receive On Thursday May I received a letter from dated April th stating that my had been cancelled but I had until the th of May to reinstate it if I filled out a questionnaire and also sent proof of my residency registration and all the IDs of the persons that were insured to drive the I could not understand what was on my payments are set up on auto pay and I am not even in the country driving the I called to ask them what was on with my policy and they referred me to underwriting I explained my situation to this department and they me that this was random and that if I did not the questionnaire and other documents to them by May that my policy would be completely cancelled I explained that this was the first letter that I had received and they they had sent me numerous mail in the past and that I had not responded I explained that I had not received any mail until now and if they could give me some more time because I was in Europe They no and that if I it to them that my policy was cancelled for good They were not willing to work with me on this So I scrambled and my friend sent me the questionnaire to fill out via email I filled it out and set up an account with docusign to fill the questionnaire out and sign it because I am in a small town in Italy and there are no places like Kinkos to print something or scan especially no places open hours Also to make things more difficult they only accept my documents via fax They not accept an email with the scanned documents I all the documents to my friend and she went to Staples to send all of the documents She went to Staples on Friday May th and sent all the documents and spent to send all the pages Once they were sent she received a confirmation that all the pages were sent which was a total of pages After all of the pages they were sent I called to make sure that they received them They me they had received the fax but several pages were not readable That I needed to send again I asked what pages were not readable and they me I need to resend the registration and a few pages from the questionnaire were not readable and that my proof of residency had not come through I that is strange because all the pages state they were sent on our end Now I have to call my friend again and have her spend to send the pages again and what if on your end they are still not coming through I asked if she could please scan the pages and email them and they stated that they were not set up to receive from email At this time I am really mad I asked if I could speak with a manager and they put me on hold for a good minutes and when they back on the phone they me the manager was not available They were not willing to work with me at all and   I am sorry your be cancelled    They I could mail them but if they do not receive in time which was Monday May the be cancelled and I cannot reinstate So that would mean that I would have to send FEDEX and have overnighted because it was Friday That would probably cost I responded   No thanks   After all of this work and time spent calling internationally I am left with my cancelled and with really no explanation why I was treated so unfairly I have never experienced such rude customer service before I did my best in the short amount of time that I had and was treated with complete disrespect  
 Think twice before using as your My was hit in a parking lot by a man who provided me with all the necessary paperwork to start a claim They refuse to cover it saying that ** the individual who hit me has not confirmed the accident therefore the claim is denied I have a copy of his driver's license and that ** provided and I made a copy Is it my fault that ** not contact them Maybe they should have a better system of contacting their policy holders beware do anything to out of paying  
My was vandalized & the perp had so did I I filed a claim on the spot They wanted to use my I no I was violated twice Recently I asked for an extension to pay my they cancelled my coverage I reinstated & then cancelled them
 I backed into a tiny pole and did pretty minimal damage to my I have with and made a claim and was recommended to go through Auto Express for the repairs I them I was leaving for the beach in about days and that I needed it before then and I able to afford a rental They assured me my would be done within business days or basically a full week been days now and the shop keeps calling me every few days to tell me what stage on and apparently painting the tiniest portion of my side fender takes + days This has been such a nightmare as missed multiple obligations and appointments I never use Auto Express again And since the company seem to care about me and my needs I be immediately looking elsewhere for auto  
 Another policy holder wrecked my parked Police were called and I immediately reported the accident to and provided the policy number to the other party and also provided the accident report days later nothing has been done states that they have been unable to reach the other party as their phone is disconnected and that I have to wait days before does anything Meanwhile days later my is still at the scene of the accident and has a different excuse every time I have called Meanwhile I have no transportation and refuses to provide a rental until they have spoken to the other people despite the fact that accident report clearly places the liability on the other party If I could rate a       I would I definitely be canceling my with once all this is resolved and NEVER return  
 Worst company ever I was starting a new policy agreed for them to take money out my account on Thursday when my pay check went in but instead they took money day before at midnight and now stuck with overdraft fee So I canceled it due to your horrible service and now have to wait business days to my money back how you lose customers  
 My husband is insured with & around had to file claim Because the adjuster assigned to his case response to an email that had been sent to CSR working on the case the adjuster only paid for days rental instead of the we HAD TO HAVE during repairs which have been found out about had I not been viewing charges to my credit card showing charge of from Enterprise This caused me some unnecessary issues & has left a BAD TASTE in my mouth when I hear the name I definitely tell friends to stay away from the company & if already with watch their backs for stabbings Having been covering America for a very long time I have thought a reputable company to stoop SO LOW  
The contract I signed for auto be paying for then you guys charge my bank account Overcharged me after I canceled you guys which I owe you nothing and you still charged me I disputed the charge with my bank 
 I had a fender bender miles an hour I had a few scratches on my front bumper The Altima had a lot of damage on the bumper that was impossible for me to have caused that kind of damage I informed the man was trying to milk the situation and I requested before any money or damage was repaired to contact me Well that did not happen they dished out k I have not had a ticket or accident in years Since I am the policy holder my wishes should have been acknowledged I have know to deny claims because of minimum damage

 On January I picked up my which is a Ferrari from auto shop I had smoked and had some new catalytic converters replaced I left the shop which is about miles from my home When I in town I stopped at a store and smelt something burning When I went to the back of my the rear bumper was melting as well as my rear tail lights I could see that the exhaust guards paint had burned off I called and they had my towed to a local shop A couple of days later I receive a call from the adjuster who she had talked with her boss and they decided to have my towed to the nearest Ferrari dealer to have it repaired The shop was not able to take my for a week so they towed it back to my house February my was towed to the Ferrari dealership about miles away from my home Spoke with the Ferrari liaison and he sent me an estimate for the repairs on March I then was referred to a different adjuster for that area The guy was rude and me that the estimate Ferrari made was wrong and they would only cover damage caused by the catalytic converters that all else I would have to pay He they did not cover mechanical damage When I asked him for a copy of what they would cover he   No   he all damages would be covered other than the exhaust and catalytic converters I asked him   so you made the determination that the catalytic converters caused the damage    He   that's what they thought    I asked   how did you come to that conclusion because if they did they should go after the manufacture    I then him that the exhaust system is a two part system and that the exhaust would have to be covered as well He he would look into it Meanwhile days went by and neither the Ferrari liaison or myself were contacted by After being at the Ferrari shop for over forty days without any work done on my I called the adjuster who me they were sending an expert out to find the cause April their expert arrived at Ferrari looked at the took some pictures talked with the Ferrari liaison and left He did not dismantle any part of my I called the adjuster and they it would be days for their analysis on what caused the damage Ferrari called them on the th and them to pick up my due to nothing being done and no decision being made On the th my was towed back to my house and here it sits did not even inform me that my was being towed back to my house When I confronted the adjuster she blamed the tow company for not calling It seems that is trying to find a way not to pay the claim This claim subrogated out either to the shop or the manufacturer of the catalytic converters update at a later time When says they provide excellence service believe them  
 I renewed my plan with and my had jumped I called for help and the representative hung up on me and when I called back because I had into a small fender bender they jumped my payment up then offered a discount of only a month if I go and PSI for a driver's course I am very unsatisfied with this

 Took out a policy for non owners auto initially called for information but pressured into buying a plan right there on the phone It cost more than when I actually had a covered through them but because the only company locally that offer the service I guess they away with charging more Terrible service they continued to charge me for coverage after I cancelled and sent collections after me recommend or use them in the future Huge rip off  
I switched from State Farm to in Feb because I was assured I would the same coverage for less I trusted and took the policy I was the victim of a hit & run in April and when I called I was I have Collision 
 I have auto quite a while and never noticed their premium adjustments due to payment directly from my checking account and recently removed my from the policy and only left old model for liability cost for yearly goes to you believe living in Long Island NY This is totally jack up pricing like we are couple of aged plus and additional driver above year old I think is becoming giant company to not care about there customer and kind of attitude my way or highway My suggestion to people who are looking for better go for shop around and you find better And first six months they quote you lower price and then they increase your premium with all kind of Sicily objection and laws you heard before There is no business ethics applied at and GOD bless America  
 I was in an accident where a ten ton wall fell on me and almost killed me I drive so I had the truck I drove put in storage I the rep this and they were supposed to give me a discounted rate Four months later today I found out the rep forgot to list it as in storage So now they are saying they do anything for me from today This means I lost over in money owed back to me use this company they are liars and thieves Horrible customer service and a disgusting excuse for an American business Absolutely awful  
 I called to inquire about Roadside Assistance I asked for basic information about the service the towing mileage that is covered and the location restriction s of where the would be towed from the point of inoperability The first person answer my questions so he forwarded me to person This person wanted to send me back to the first person but I advised her that I was sent to her because he know the information She finally asked me a couple questions and gave me some limited information about where the would be towed She never me about any mileage restrictions She also kept asking me if I wanted to add the service I her that I wanted more information before making that decision I was finally that a would be towed to the nearest repair facility She also quoted me a price that was three times the price on their website if you sign into your account With that in mind I wanted to all the details before online to my own account and adding it myself The online account barely gives any information at all and does not go into any detail about the services offered Eventually she asked what was wrong with my I stated   I want to be safe in case something goes wrong with my engine or something in the future    She then advised me that she was documenting our entire conversation and my be eligible for towing if it was anything related to the engine I thought that was hilariously absurd But then I was furious Is she a mechanic I never my has an engine problem It was merely an example Why would anybody else want roadside assistance Are they to come out and diagnose my and then tell me they tow it because engine related I asked her why and she stated   this is now a pre existing condition    I asked to speak to her manager Her manager stated that the customer representative did nothing wrong and an company so what did I expect I was so furiously angry I her “I would cancel my coverage because of this experience” and “goodbye” I never raised my voice or acted unprofessional I was at my breaking point as far as irritated so the only reason I off the phone before asking to speak to her manager and figuring out how to file a formal complaint against these specific individuals  
 On website it says that   in the event my is totaled With all is not lost never fun to have your totaled but you at least take comfort in the silver lining of coverage If your policy covers a total loss will Pay the actual cash value of the plus applicable state fees and taxes less any deductible Take ownership of the We transfer the title into our name and then sell the to a salvage buyer or you may keep the yourself see below for details Actual Cash Value the fair market value of property technically replacement cost less depreciation Depreciation the decrease in value of any property due to wear tear and or time Generally depreciation is not an insurable loss    My was totaled The person that hit me had as well determined that the other driver was % at fault and so they mailed me a check for the amount of my deductible Good so far but then I was given a copy of the valuation report The valuation report is produced by a company called CCC This report that my was worth and then they depreciated based on previous damage and wear less about added taxes and licensing offering me a settlement of In my estimation that is not fair market value They me that my policy cover replacement but rather the actual cash value of the Referring back to the website it says that Actual Cash value is technically replacement cost less depreciation I looked around and I find a similar that I could by for less than The I was offered as a settlement is not replacement cost less depreciation is less than low NADA value That is not replacement cost The report also listed dealers that had the same year and model for under I called every dealer listed on the valuation report and what I learned is that the information is inaccurate outdated and in a few cases may have been a complete fabrication I explained all this to the rep and was simply that they had reviewed the information that I sent and were unable to make any adjustments to the value of the So as a customer right now I feel like I have been lied to ignored and that their ultimate goal is to cheat me out of what I have paid for I asked my Credit Union to look up the book value according to NADA They gave me a low value of and a high value of So what they did is they started out with a value lower than NADA low value and then depreciated This is fundamentally wrong because if you take away the previous damage what you have is a that is worthy of High book value So as I see it they have cheated me out of about k If you have you better hope you ever have to use it  
 Twice has cancelled my coverage because an auto payment was refused by my bank For years I understood that auto pay was coming directly from my checking account but instead it was being withdrawn through my VISA ATM card My VISA ATM card was hacked this February so I cancelled and replaced with a new one I did not notify because I believed the payments were NOT being made through my ATM account Without warning a phone call an email or any other form of contact my policy was suddenly cancelled and my fees were RAISED if I chose to sign up again as a 'new' customer No attempt was made by to payment by any other means before the March cancellation without cannot drive my and do not know which company to trust after this screw over I NEVER go with again no matter how 'cute' the stupid little GECKO is Still looking for something I afford Do not understand the info you want below The insured by was destroyed in a accident

 My husband was rear ended standing still at a light Hit so hard he was severely for life injured The he drove was totaled at scene Driver admitted % fault Hit so hard police report shows his damaged other in front of him As paid for his immediate consistent medical care which bills every week consume to a mountain too My husband could not work no more He enjoyed his kids Loved them more than anything Took them everywhere They lived spending their time with him I left my job to help him I loved my job I did not quit Then months later after only little money each week for PIP lost wages But we were not asking for the world so we shut up They sent him to of their own IMEs who all came back in favor to him but that sentence from the doctor has torn our family apart Left us on skid row foreclosure and barely food The doctor stated he work but less than before and guarded My husband pushed papers on a desk for a living Mind you I have teen young boys and pregnant a year before accident A follow up to them same doctors months ago have stated my husband has worsened and work Our lawyer sent a demand letter to resume our payments and still nothing An arbitration lawyer was hired and we are on nearly months of no money used all our savings and children's college money to survive We are at under to survive now Lights heat and all be shut off We have borrowed and begged for help Had neighbors help us with some food gift cards thank you God for people who care We always did the right thing by others and never cheated anyone nor the IRS While we were a cash business our entire business my husband has lost since accident I now am subjected to leaving my children at night time including my year old My teens watch her as my husband is not functional enough to watch her alone His vision is gone barely see Went to professionals to not even worry about the other idiot IMEs ophthalmologist that give eye exams and label you fine They have no idea Thank you God above that an IME is of the hardest to beat yet no denying my husband's injuries He has had a complex prescription to have special glasses made to see and try to live and see a somewhat normal life has denied his eyeglasses Imagine this they in beginning if he wore glasses and they broke due to accident we would replace but since ongoing claim they pay WTF He seem perfect before accident now he's horrible like a year old man He suffers a bad brain injury Along declared legally blind He's so bad at remembering anything blackouts dazes off to space during conversation contemplates suicide seen on emails he's reached out to njhope com many times His headaches are so bad he needs a wash cloth and dark rooms to relax and cry Sad And could care less I suggest the envelope every month that we discontinued after am if we pay I strongly never ever use this company Liars Could care less about a family but wants your money on time or done I believe in Karma and coming to them I lost my valuable time my children needs me for at night No more dinners together Nothing And all for what Cause they pay what's deserved to us And in black & white from their own doctors My husband has set his mind for of the most complicated surgeries on a table He's in brain rehab weekly but never be the same Never remember important events in our life Now our children have diminished their relationship with him cause of a violent attitude he snaps to After multiple requests for the correct rehab after MRI scans of his head etc they still ignore by buying time and ignoring calls from their adjusters I love this man but exhausted Never thought Warren Buffett would run a company like this shamble DO NOT CHOOSE THEY SCREW YOU IN THE END  
 Firstly I had a lady rear end the side of my ONLY requested photos of the damage Not once did they send someone out to inspect the damage I that they tell from photos if it was my fault or hers Well of not you tell everything from a picture Luckily the lady's company came out and saw that it was her fault and I have to pay anything out of pocket to fix the damage SECONDLY their website states that if your glass needs repaired then the deductible be waived This is a LIE Spoke with an attitude of a lady who barely wanted to listen to what I had to say and she no matter what deductible would have to be paid but because a windshield be replaced for less than the deductible then I would have to pay out of pocket Now here I am asking myself   why do I even have full coverage with    Because they do not provide any sort of relief or help at all  
 I filed a claim on because I was coming from work in Goochland and a deer ran into the road and I swerve to avoid hitting the deer and side swipe a tree on the passenger side of my truck which left my with a dent on the fender and my mirror came off and some other minor damages I call and file my claim and because I need to call the police my claim went under investigation They me I need phone records as if I killed someone They ask me personal questions like who do I live with where do I work and some other dumb question OK I them I provide them with the phone records because the phone is not in my name so they sent me a paper saying I have to come and swear under oath at some court and I need to bring bank statements pictures of my and once again my phone record but when I talked to the adjuster on last week he stated all he need was a copy of my title and he would give me the cost of the damage which total up to what my is worth which is minus the hundred dollar deductible I feel as if they are taking me thru a bunch red tape and distress for that lil bit of money talking about because I have with then in about a year which I was with company I feel like their business what I had before them I feel that does not make any sense I had with when I side swipe the tree so irrelevant who I had before them I have witness that vouch for me to let them know that there was nothing wrong with my prior to my accident on but I want to me a lawyer and to channel on my side They are about to lose a lot of customer behind this I never refer any to and I canceled my policy because if how they treat paying customers they need to reevaluate their customer service skills  
 I had a perfect driving record for over years when I into my first accident The Sheriff agreed that it was a weather related accident but I was technically at fault because my spun out and hit two other I called the next morning My policy was near its expiration so they renewed my policy and took my payment Then I was transferred to the claims adjuster and everything went wrong I was that I have because I missed a payment in October of the previous year I pay my in full or a few months at a time so I knew this was some sort of error on their end I have proof of payment but accept it Now I am being charged as an uninsured driver and I am personally responsible for fixing I had paid the balance of my policy with a VISA gift card I had received a large sum of money on the card and decided to use it to ahead with bills When the card was used up I took a screen shot of all of the activity for my records I have the actual card anymore It was useless once all of the money was spent accept my proof of payment because it is not drawn on a bank account They gave me a list of criteria for the proof of payment that is impossible to for a disposable gift card rep at flat out   If you paid with a gift card you are screwed    The last resort is to file a complaint with the state commission and hope that they force to accept the proof of payment If they take money from a disposable gift card then they should accept the gift card's proof of payment I have to go to court and beg them not to suspend my license I am being sued by people My is in bad shape and I am afraid to drive it I never thought a nationwide company like would do something like this Because of their   policy   the life I worked so hard to build is destroyed  
 Being with State Farm for years I was spoiled by the level of service they provided Recently I was in a accident that was clearly the fault of the other person They admitted it and the witnesses agreed Despite that did absolutely nothing to assist me I had to call the other person's company and negotiate the settlement did call me several weeks after the claim was initiated to contact information for the other person They want to ensure they to file a claim against me or I understand their concern but think my company should be an advocate for me and not trying to protect themselves unfortunate be calling State Farm later today  
 Today I called to renew my policy It lapsed due to a change in income and I am now able to back on track The rep I spoke with stated I had to pay the past due amount in order to renew my policy No problem so I authorized the payment over the phone and it was accepted Based on her statement to me I was expecting her to say next that my policy is restored and new cards were being issued wrong the rep next stated that she had to rerun the entire process from the beginning Although I dropped a driver off my coverage my wife and I are both in our mid 's clear clean driving records she quoted me a rate that was double my previous rate and tried to charge me over to re apply When I asked why the increase double she had no explanation but to blame the system I politely hung up went to carrier paid out the door with a premium what was trying to charge I hope is OK losing business because I am gone forever I also share my negative experience with everyone I know This should not be hard because there are signs everywhere that state “If you have DO NOT bring your here    The next time I drive by one I take a photo as proof and post Good luck everyone  
 I know that if you have a lien on your you suppose to liability I went that route cause raised my premiums over an accident that my fault and I asked a question about my policy cause a deer hit me twice and the agent me if I full coverage again they cover me WRONG I did exactly what she to do and from there I the run around I was no no and no they cannot do it so they have lost a good customer They want to help you out even when they say sorry that happen to you Oh that is BS BS BS If they were that damn sorry they do everything in their power to correct your issue So I have canceled my policy  
 My husband's was impounded a week ago when a police officer pulled the over We showed him our current that we've been paying on but he they had no record that we had for his Apparently a rep turned in the wrong VIN # to the DMV for my husband's so all these years months of paying on his show up with the DMV We had to pay to our cleared with the DMV and it out of the impound lot I was furious we tried contacting and they kept giving us the run around We even went into the office they have here and the workers claimed they deal with that stuff We a copy of when our started with because online they only show the most recent month covered Now we are out and looking for a new auto company who actually give the correct VIN # to the DMV so our impounded again  
 It was bad enough to involved into a accident but definitely make it worse without question Truly bothered by the way claim reps handled my accident report claim Both me and the other party were both customers I was given two different claim numbers did not tell me which is which and both with my name on it with my name misspelled and wrong DOB NOTE the with all the WRONG information turned out to be MY claim A agent called me while I was on the phone with a agent reporting the accident confusing enough I was my claim was assigned to a rep Received a voice mail from a lady who identified herself as rep during lunch time at around PM on the same day of the accident we called her right back thinking she might be our rep Oddly enough she never identified herself as   the other party's rep   until we finished the recordings I wonder is this the proper way to treat customers I mean I understand she is representing the other party but I felt as if I was tricked and blindfolded throughout the whole process I am still mentally distressed by the accident itself but I never pointed finger at anyone This rep me she represents the other party AFTER she ended the recording with me she alleges I HIT the other tire which is NOT true and she then concluded the phone interview   do you understand that you might be % responsible for the liability because you hit OUR tire    Tried to trick me to agree that I was at fault Note this she used the words   OUR car   referring to the other party's How would you feel if you were me Especially after a accident Talking someone while you were trying to have your first bite of food for the whole day Is this how always intimidate other party's customers I did not receive any call text email from my own rep not until everything was finalized days later What is the point of having a like this Definitely not recommended unless you really want to have the feeling of not being COVERED on the road or want to have a representative that does not represent you at all Made a complaint received a call from a supervisor from the next morning who me she send an adjuster to inspect my damaged within days Guess what That happen we waited days to find out they are not sending an adjuster over I was my rep works from AM PM and then she called me at PM each day me it is quite alright to give out all the info to the other rep Well sorry but not okay from a customer point of view claim repeated my story times to different people from what a great way to help you recover from a accident with all the mental distress The who really should listen to my story did not listen all information came from the other party's rep because she is from too If paying % extra money give me a peace in mind then so be it I am so fed up with all these and not to stay with Thank you for NOTHING for the past years  
 After years of insuring our golf cart and some properties with my wife has her first claim big but an Their adjuster and her boss want to have the repaired at a body shop known locally as a hack shop using replacement parts that are not O E M and known for poor quality work bad enough that the auto repair business is commonly known to be corrupt but we are extremely disappointed to this kind of service along with an attitude that does not experience when they are selling to you Why is it that I trade my money in return for them taking the risk but never quite that way Buyer beware there are only two honest companies in America and Chubb or Chartis  
 According to I changed too much having changed some this last year Last being a Bentley GTC Each time I contacted my company to let them know when I sold a and replaced with one It was a year that I experienced a variety of settling upon my current BMW cancelled my policy without any notification well at least as of yet that they planned to no longer insure me I have no points on my license and no accidents that were my fault I had uninsured motorist pull out in front of me on a highway doing mph and slowed to mph before T boning the other The driver turned out to be unlicensed and uninsured After trying to go after the driver foot the bill on the repairs and me it would not affect my rates due to No fault They lied rates went up I endured because I have had them for a number of years I am speechless to find that they are cancelling me and unwilling to insure me because I had too many changes last year This seem ethical to me I followed the laws and made changes as required by law been a loyal customer of for yearsssss and yet am Penalized for it like most companies has lost their morality Too many changes You have to be kidding me This is a dumb rule and be at the expense of a loyal consumer I hope others read this and reconsider the relationship with They I could try back in months I wont be doing that And hope enough patrons follow suit When companies take patronage for granted this kind of crap happens Truly Unethical  
 My son was involved in a accident on When I was contacted by I was informed that my coverage had cancelled on I never received any notice by mail or phone from them When I explained this to the adjuster she transferred me to the payment department and I paid immediately I then spoke with the adjuster again and explained that I had not received notice and asked why they did not contact me by phone She they do not have people to call customers yet they spend millions in advertising The adjuster there was still a chance they would cover the claim After weeks I received a call from the adjuster and that upper management decided I was not covered thus leaving me with a wrecked and a payment and no means to the repaired If I could rate at stars I would  
 Stalling to process claim Have given police reports and all information and they are putting me off Has been weeks meanwhile I have no no rental and lost wages from missing work

 This guy was taking care of my file of his clients ran a red light and hit me saying it was yellow but clearly I was already stopped since it was red for me so I proceeded when it turned green for me Long story short I had no witness number or names and to take blame for it So I was willing to go back at the same time on the same route to find someone since we were all on our way to work and he laughed and   What are you to stand there and ask who saw what happened    Very rude guy Luckily I did go back at the same time and found a witness that takes the same route I had to wear a neck brace and miss work and this guy laughs John ** representative you are rude guy  
 A policy holder hit me while traveling on I totaling the drivers side of my The policy holder took % responsibility as well as she was cited by the police as % at fault yet pay for my medical cost I sustained physical injury to my neck back and right arm I am on a heavy dose of anti inflammatory and have loss full use of my right arm In addition I am emotional scared and fear driving and on the freeway The claims representative only wants to address physical injury and he cover the emotional stress unless I opened a claim with my policy I have zero responsibility for the injury to my property my physical and my emotional self yet wants to bleed me dry and expects me to pay for all medical cost up front from start to finish Hell also a policy holder this is horrible  
 I was a loyal customer of for years and then last summer after a rain storm my rained out because my sunroof close Looking into some options I wanted to see if my was insured for comprehensive coverage and see if it would cover my rained out carpets in my When the adjuster came I home My was in the driveway so I guess he did whatever he did and then a day later I a call back From the way the rep who was handling my case was making it sound I was covered and I was also covered from additional damage that they found on the right side of my from a tree that scraped it during hurricane Sandy So I thought great I both done and have my look like new again Well I went to the auto body place on the day of my appointment with them The Auto body place kept telling me that my claim kept kicked out of their system which meant that the Auto body worker look at my for an estimate they me So I called my claim rep to ask why my claim kept kicked out of their system and they me that something happened to their system but they would back to me as soon as it came back up Well a couple of weeks go by and I first a letter from saying that they are cancelling my policy because I inquired about my comprehensive coverage and in addition listed on the letter three other reasons that were false and claimed that they information on me from the Freedom of information Act Basically they left me with having to find a new company within two weeks of the letter So I paid my final payment to them so I would not have a gap in coverage and then went to company The rep from the other company looked up my history for me and found that lied claimed that they had paid out money to me for the damage on the right side of my to be fixed Well if that was the case then I still have damage to the right side of my from hurricane Sandy I never received any money for my to be fixed So after being with my other company for a week I a new letter from stating that they are cancelling my policy for non payment even though I did pay them I was a loyal customer for years but after them pulling all of this and damaging my credit rating I never insure with again if they are the last company on earth  
 Daughter totaled her Honda Accord offered her for her before deductible while commenting was in nice condition other than accident damage had received good care or average as reviewed by a dealer I researching a replacement and doing some online research between and actual auction reports she would have to have been an authorized auto dealer with access to dealer auctions to buy a at replacement quote  
I had an accident where the policy holder was % at fault The police gave him a ticket claims that their policy holder was only % at fault This seems to be a pattern with them Always offer only % and hope that the fish bite 
They tell you thing But they lie You’re covered under with but it’s not effected till the next day They don’t tell you this That doesn’t even make sense to be covered but it says it’s not effective 
 As part of my policy I pay for roadside assistance every month Tuesday February my starter went out on my truck so I called for roadside assistance I spent about an hour on the phone with a customer service rep while she tried to find a tow truck to my truck moved At about PM she me that she had not yet been able to find a tow truck for me but that she would keep trying and call me when she found someone I went ahead and left and left the key in the truck for when she did find a tow truck An hour or so later she called me and informed me that she was not able to a tow truck and that it would now be my responsibility to my truck towed Basically even though I pay for roadside service they were unable to provide me with what I am paying them for I went back the next day around PM to my truck running and found that someone had sideswiped it in the driver side On the bottom of both doors on that side of the truck the paint is scraped off and there is paint transfer from Both doors are smashed in The front door likely be fixed with Bondo and paint but the back probably need to be replaced as the damaged portion be bonded and still function The damaged area is approximately inches long by inches tall My contention is that was negligent in providing me the service that I pay them for every month and should therefore be responsible to fix the damage to my truck If they had provided the service that I am paying them for then there would be no damage to my truck This hit and run accident is a direct result of their failure I spoke to on two separate occasions and was that this would be covered under my policy and that I would only have to pay a deductible of However since the damage is due to their negligence I believe that this should have to be covered by my policy or that I should have to pay any deductible should pay % of the repairs I have put this at star however I am not angry and have not gotten angry but I am much more than dissatisfied

 I have private auto with I wanted to commercial auto for a new business I asked them first They quoted me a price for very minimal coverage k k + deductible I took it thinking that is normal for commercial ins It bothered me and I checked with a competitor and found for the same price I times the coverage and no deductible I was appalled since I have been with for many years I the other policy and proceeded to cancel I paid something for the commercial policy and cancelled in days My refund is I questioned where did the money go and they cost of writing the policy What a crock Tomorrow I leave town and when I back bye bye for good on my private auto policies I am also to my money’s worth by spreading the word about This is how treats their good customers P S I had to give them star because there is no rating for or less  
 Let me start off by saying not a customer nor would I ever be at this point On New Year's Eve I was rear ended while stopped at a stop light It was a younger girl that hit me she was shaken up and kept apologizing so I have nothing against her for that However the way her has handled this has been a nightmare has yet to come out and look at my They are basing adjustments off of pictures that they have gotten from my body shop My body shop do anything until has come out and looks at the damages which is about worth of damages They cut my body shop a check for thinking that would cover the damages HAHA been without my and have paid payments for some ** rental that I was stuck in I no to return my calls from and starting to think if ever my back in a timely manner is the absolute worst company I have ever had to deal with

 During a call for auto I repeatedly the associate I would not buy a policy during this call It was a quote He continued to try to push the sale I stated after repeated clarification   I have you three times I am not buying a policy   he tried again I upset and him angrily that he was being pushy and that I would not do business with him I hung up An hour later I went to check my email and there was an email from him AGAIN TRYING TO SELL ME A POLICY Major crossing of boundaries I called and registered a harassment complaint with the company

 I had an auto policy with some months ago that I purchased online After a few months I received a letter stating that my policy had been cancelled due to failure to provide driver's license information which I had not been prompted to provide Today I noticed that they've continued to charge me monthly for more than months I spoke to a customer service representative who claimed that the policy had not in fact been cancelled until last month but gave no explanation as to why it would have been but the mail I received and my account online state otherwise certain I was not covered by any policy during this time however they made away with well over before I read a bank statement and caught them at it  
 If you are thinking that representative be keeping you up to date with the ongoing activities then FORGET ABOUT IT I was promised that I my in week of time but when I the estimate email it was days I was still OK with it But then whenever I called the representative every time I was redirected to his voice mail After trying for days of calling + no answers from him I decided to call customer center and they were too not able to reach him They they email the person I did not stopped calling the representative and finally day I was able to hold of him over phone and he that   we are looking good for tomorrow   please do remember that it was on th day and I am not including weekends Also when I called him the next day in the morning he again   yes we are good for today in the evening    But when I reached to the collision center he was not there and the same old story of me talking to his voice mail begin After days his voice mail message was changed and it   out of time and be back on Monday    Immediately I called customer center I was informed that # yes they were also not able to hold of him and # my be ready by next Friday It is the WORST Customer Service that I have faced Those who are thinking of a auto please please please do not consider it Here are the date in which they occurred th Jan collision was inspected and that it take week of time th Jan estimate email mentioning days from Mr ** Henrico Until nd called Mr ** every time reaching his voice mail and no response rd Jan called Mr ** first after reaching to his voice mail then called customer service center th Jan called Mr ** again and he me that be ready by th th Jan morning call with Mr ** with confirmation th Jan Went to body shop only after calling Mr ** first The call went to voice mail in the evening and saw that the is still not ready th Jan Mr ** voice mail says he is out of town and be back on Monday i e nd Feb th Jan Called customer center and talked with Mr ** He that now I am looking next week Friday for my I know why has kept employees that do not value customer and importantly never listen ignore customer's voice mails please hire someone else or Lose your customers I am still waiting for reply from Mr **

 I had a policy with them for about years and no claims or tickets with them or anyone ever They lost a customer for good Even if I could a cheaper or better policy from them I never a quote from them I recommend them to anyone and advised everyone to drop them A few of my friends dropped them and went through the same thing I found a bit cheaper company and called to cancel before my policy ended the th About a month after my policy ended I a notice that I owe them about for days after my policy ended I called them min wait by the way I them I cancelled before the th What that should mean to them is I want their services and not be paying for anymore They tell me they have record of the call and so BS that they have to cover me days after by law I care if they have to cover me for a year by law not my problem My policy ends on the th all that I agreed to pay They I have to provide them with proof that I was covered for the days WTF I have to prove to them that I have why Are they cops now I have to go out of my way to prove to them that I need their ** service I them I have proof I was covered for more than half the last month I was covered under them I a refund for those days Of course not I care about my credit too much so I send in my proof and they tell me it take hours to process total of mins on the phone Great a good thing I give them the automatic pay cause they would have taken whatever they wanted Probably take months to a check from them Then I tell him to give me his first and last name his location and confirmation number for the phone call in case the record goes missing and I him that I was to call back to double check that confirmation number I hours goes by and I still have any confirmation I call them back and yell at them this time cause it was hours Lady freaks out sorry what happens when you work for crooks and asks me to send it again She processes it It took minutes of waiting and she would pop in every mins to ask if I was still there After the second time she did that I yelled “OMG HURRY WITH THE PROCESS I’M STILL HERE ” I her I wanted to put a complaint on the last guy cause he me that it would be processed in hours and it wasn't I had his name and everything I took down her name address and would call back to check if everything is processed So yeah when you do decide to leave them be prepared to spend about an hour or more of your time to prove to them you have It really be any of their damn business if insured or not When I meet someone that works for to immediately threat them like scums of the earth

 I was involved in an accident on i Michigan My was the only in the incident it sustained front and rear damage I have a dash cam and reviewing the incident it is obvious that it was simple bad luck that I hit a patch of black ice But that the issue in fact the lady to whom I spoke was very professional and very kind I'm sure that it is part of the training but nevertheless it was welcomed Sadly the good part ends there I was recommended to take my to CDE in Canton Michigan a drive in the damaged of some miles however I was assured that by doing so I would be in a better position to have the damage estimate taken care of quicker and it would be done in place When I arrived I was that I scheduled to be there until the following Tuesday anyone watching the news would have seen the i disaster that involved + I was at the tail end of that it was on Friday the th of January Thus I was not eligible for a rental until the night before the appointment four days later This alone is a ridiculous scenario to find yourself in but since I was committed to being somewhere that evening I rented personally Both the people at CDE and the representative from were there and I informed both that I could not return until the following Saturday as I was traveling I stated this to both them and the Enterprise rental representative that I would be back on the Saturday My week passed and my wife me that the estimator had stated the was 'a total loss' My wife even me that she had been what the claim would be I should mention that literally at the end of we had decided to increase my deductible to to reduce costs since I had not had an accident in years of driving that was bad luck and a temptation that fate had to jump on but that is life When I returned on the Saturday AM was to be returned before noon I was greeted with no representative from Enterprise to receive the rental even though he that there would be someone there and worst still no The representative had authorized the removal of the without consent I was fuming but there I was with no and no chance of resolving it until the Monday Yet again I am in the lurch about the time Monday came and I was on the phone the moment my eyes opened I spoke with HQ and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who is the supervisor of the total loss department She gave me the contact names and numbers of various people that could help me resolve this situation The real issue was that I had personal property in the that I wished to recover Eventually it was arranged that I could drive miles round trip to the 'salvage' yard to recover my property I did and then I waited minutes while they obtained authorization from to allow me access to my I should note that at this point the was in my name I literally had the title in my hands and I had received nothing from Finally I was allowed to go to the and recover my property however this involved into a greasy muddy and miserable yard to my was unceremoniously presented to me on a fork lift truck in case you think this is bad when I into my the only things that were still in there were the things that were literally bolted down everything else had been 'stolen' I use that word because I had left my in the care of CDE and and now my property was gone and I still held the title The contents amounted to about in my estimation I have since remembered that I also had an OBDII device in of the rear door pockets that I cannot account for and that alone was But the real complaint is that that they could only cover up to for personal property which I have since been paid as well as the total loss payout But forget all of that pay attention to the fact that they were placed in the care of my CDE and and that removing someone's property without their consent is theft they broke the law As the owner of that I should have called the Canton police and reported it stolen something should be done about a company such as in cooperation with CDE effectively stole my As a result of some black ice on the i and yes I was driving carefully I am happy to show the dash cam video along with the CDE and an unfortunate decision to have a large deductible I am now out of pocket to the order of nearly and it involves a theft that never was I only hope that begin following the letter of the law and abide by the legal requirement to actually seek the owners permission before disposing of their personal property Noting that actually paying attention to the customer in this case     be back Saturday   may improve some impressions that people have  
 Last year December me and my boyfriend was in taco bell drive thru The in front of us was at the window My boyfriend was the driver and I was the passenger at the time I was looking down at my phone next thing I know the in front of us slammed into the and I mean it was like it was done purposely hard That driver is a insured driver He then hop out saying “I'm sorry sorry” and he tell us everything is OK but it I that suffered from whiplash because my head was down at the time and my boyfriend had a recent accident about a year and a half ago and it made his back pains come back But we thought we were fine until days later when I began to have the aches in my neck And me and my boyfriend went to nearby chiropractor to see if we were OK We both suffered from minor injuries I then went down town to pick up police report so I could go ahead and file a claim They tell us the police even make a report of it because there was under dollars worth of damages done to the we were in a crown Victoria I would think not What about our pain So I called agent she a woman named Tanisha would be our adjuster She called us ask all the questions in the world we her everything days later she say she in touch with driver and she would keep us updated and she if she was able to contact them after days she the settle it from there Two weeks after to chiropractor we call she never at her desk they say so she called back the next day to say “we still talked to anyone keep you updated ” more weeks go by and she finally contacted the driver and says she still working on the case We went out pictures tooling of damages They did also She accepted damage claim that was under maybe week went by I tried calling again could not in contact with this woman at all Throughout the whole claim we talked times out of like days She left a message last week I had no miss call she stated we’re still investigating the bodily claim After almost two months We only did treatment for two weeks and here we are now still contact this Tanisha woman I understand why it’s taking them so long to pay chiropractor and paying for damage still nothing at all months later and the claim is still open We have our lawyer on it now It’s a shame we had to hire a lawyer for such small claim it shows how careless they are And Tanisha is very careless and I say she need to be retrained for the job  
 ' REJECTED ME IN MIN OR LESS ' Despite an immaculate record honorable discharge USAF Flight Surgeon and combat veteran with zero criminal record merely accidents neither of which involved tickets one 'non moving ' They poached USAA's assessment and 'No' due to 'Claim History ' Moreover now that I know ownership via Mr Buffett and progressive political affiliations which seem decidedly anti military I join even if free for life I hate Trojan Horses and hypocrisy The commercials are cool though Thank you for reading  
 I received a pages business questionnaires from Underwriters last Oct It stated that failure to provide this may result in termination or cancellation of the service I was with this company for more than years and have insured I have only claim windshield breakage due to a stone I never had any reviews or updates with Underwriters from previous company that I had in the past After I submitted the questionnaires I thought everything went well as I did not hear from I found out yesterday after logging on to website that my policy was cancelled last Dec rd Thank God no accident happened to me and my family I called underwriters asking them why my policy was cancelled and me that there were missing documentation in the questionnaires which I think are minor and not important considering the answers are on their other questions This person by the name of Toni ** me that it’s their POLICY not to call the client if there are missing or if the questionnaires are incomplete This is what I called a negligent and irresponsible customer service by I asked the person “how my be reinstated” and me that I have to complete the form and asked them to fax it to me Well to make the story short I did not any fax and they have all these excuses that their fax keep redialing my number but am all the faxes from Pharmacies with no problem Gave them fax number same thing happened no fax Basically drop you if they are enough from you So be careful in choosing a reputable company  
 I agree more with the negative reviews I had the WORST   customer service   experience with and after + years of being insured by you I be leaving ASAP I looked at our auto policy breakdown on this past Saturday I wondered why my older was costing us more than my husband's newer to insure On Sat I was by a rep that it was due to my numerous accidents I asked what accidents never had any I was then they discuss it with me I would have to speak to Claims which in until Tuesday I called this morning the rep me I had to speak to Tyler ** in Claims After numerous tries I finally reached Ms ** who me I had a claim for backing in and pulling out of a parking spot and scratching my I explained to her I know what that was from I called a while back asking what my deductible was for damage from someone KEYING my I never opened a claim since the deductible was high and it certainly would not have been worth it My DMV record is completely clean I tried numerous times to explain this to Ms ** She kept repeating the same thing over and over I was nowhere with her I asked her   why this was on my at all And how do I it off    She me I have to speak to a rep and transferred me to the policy rep I again explained to this rep what was on Policy rep me I had to speak to Claims I explained to her how Claims me I had to speak to her She asked me to hold I was on hold for minutes She returned to the phone thanking me for holding briefly I her there was nothing brief about it She that she tried to reach a supervisor left messages for them asked me to call back tomorrow I explained to her how this was day TWO of calls on this for me She reiterated me calling again tomorrow for   THE BEST CARE   hysterical I her never mind I would be switching my and renter's to company ASAP with my husband who is a Veteran and current Federal Govt employee You are a customer service JOKE  
 saved us over dollars compared to our current policy when we added our teenage daughter to the policy I was afraid the customer service would be below average if we had an accident but I was so wrong We had an at fault accident and was wonderful Each time I did something online about the accident someone from called me to explain the next step They paid for all the damage without any problems We have also used them many times when we locked the keys out of the and they are always easy to contact and very friendly I would highly recommend them 
 I purchased full coverage with which included comprehensive coverage It turns out that full coverage with means fools coverage I was under the impression that full coverage is what the word means I was hit by a hit and run driver hit in the rear left side I ended up on the guard rail totaling my I did not see the driver it was raining really heavy and it happened so fast I sustained injuries that being covered by my own personal I called to report it they I covered They lied to me they use deceptive practice with their coverage confusing and like ordering a la cart from a menu So they are basically calling me a liar and are sending an accident reconstructor What a joke any person that looks at the tell it was hit from behind They continued to take my payments even though I need to keep the insured I found company that gave me all the coverage I wanted for a hundred dollars cheaper company is liars and thieves They are giving me the run around making excuses after excuses I am reporting them to federal commission better business bureau and filing a law suit against their unethical misleading and confusing practices  
 Unacceptable service from I was promised my would be ready in days I was informed on DAY TWO by the body shop that Service Representative Matt would approve the extra parts needed Guess what Nothing happened on Day TWO A LOST DAY for ME Now DAY THREE and expecting my is ready After all a day job right what I was and I made my plans accordingly Well NO calls me from the body shop SO I HAVE TO CALL It turns out the SERVICE REP Matt still approved Now I have to WAIT UNTIL THE END OF FRIDAY Are you kidding me You wasted a whole week with my waiting for approval from the Rep for a day job Thanks a lot I recommended my Mom and her to switch from Liberty Mutual to Wow thanks a lot You really know how to say thanks for sending us the business Instead it feels like you gave ME the business the wrong kind I am deeply disappointed this is taking so long  
 I have been a customer for four years and then I went to delay a payment week after them overdrafting my account last month dollars and my bank charged me with a dollar overdraft fee And I tried calling a day and a half before to postpone the payment two days and it matter cause apparently you need days for them to process something that a chimp could do in ten minutes Aside from that now they canceled on me for not even being a week late I never go through them again they are greedy and they value their customers You’re a number and money not a person with a family I wish with all my heart that shut down  
 I have been with for almost years Today I called to renew my policy but they me that they no longer cover me without any previous warnings They claimed that they had sent me a letter in the mail which I never received They never called or sent me any emails even though I am enrolled in paperless notification What shocked me was the reason for their decision After interrogating me for two hours on the phone it turns out that this whole issue was because two months ago I called them to a quote about a POSSIBLE third driver for of the three I have under my policy I never added that third driver to my policy since I no longer needed one They held it against me and refused to renew my My husband and I never had any accidents we have three young children and are very cautious drivers They did not have any convincing reason to their decision Their agents were very unprofessional and asked way too many personal questions Because I was desperate I uncomfortably tried my best to answer their questions Still they denied me coverage currently covered by company and pay more than extra a year still glad that not with After this bad experience I definitely not recommend to anyone  
 driver made illegal u turn to go west and then decided to make illegal u turn to go east and cut my right way off Driver police he was making u turns Driver he was making a left turn and I ran into him but there is no street to make left turn at and I have no front end damage to prove I ran into driver and never came out to look into matter nor send adjuster 
 In May I had an accident Thank you God no hurt except I called to claim that incident and be tow my Everything was ok took all accident information about accident The lady was so nice and trying to help me All of a sudden their voice and caring feeling was gone They me that I am an excluded driver on my policy and not responsible at any expenses I was already in accident shock and they give me second one employee who was talking with me sound like this   We care about you We care you had a accident You should not be driving that All your fault    I totally forgot about being excluded driver I did on and they kept me in this way years Truly I have forgotten otherwise I change the policy I was thinking that my Uninsured part cover me It was some misunderstanding My issue was all my mistake I accept it but as a big company they at least send a towing truck and charge me the fee I felt I am so alone nobody wants to help Even people on the phone employees I was in need of some soft voice that explain me the situation I wish we all listen to that conversation Later on I called my case lady to ask paper which I signed She sounded like   What are you trying to We care about you Why you calling and bothering us I am busy with texting It is your fault you should not take your name as a driver    So dear please train more some of your employee to be more careful with their voice tone so customer like me not offended Thank you I am still paying that accident debt Thank you  
 This is a horrible unethical company a customer with an excellent driving record who has been driving for over years and I recently rear ended by Customer at a stop sign with my five year old child in the back My had about worth of damage and the young man who hit me had a lot more damage I was at zero mph and the guy who hit me was or so been almost a month and I have moderate lower and middle back pain and never ever had back problems tried to give me and close my claim Unbelievable I no I went to a chiropractor who adjusted my back and I was out of alignment The woman handling the case is a shark and here I am totally honest I even my neck did not hurt What in earth do you have for Like to the doctor and chiropractor for the fun of it a stay home mother so not like they have to pay for lost wages They are highly unethical and closed my claim stating a minor accident I guess we are a lawyer now ridiculous that they not pay for a couple of chiropractor appointments and help minor injury What a waste of time and energy for everyone  
 I recently a quote and activated the policy online Why did also charge me separately for a past due policy from which was under my EX husband's name also I was informed by Lisa ** that refund me the past due but would gladly cancel my policy and refund that amount Also she advised that there was a disclaimer regarding past due amounts being due along with the quote amount LIAR I saw no such   disclaimer   and now I pay the rest of my bills this week I really wish that someone would step on that damn lizard and call it a day Bunch of THIEVES  
 My son had parked his at walgreens and insured by backed into him They exchanged information not a lot of damage I called the company to inform them what had happened and asked if I should call police They not to worry they would take care of it and to uploaded damage photos to the claim they started Week went by and hadn’t heard anything so I called they were nice and explained that they hadn’t been able to a hold of the driver they insured Which means they couldn’t do anything until they did I have called every week for weeks and they keep saying they haven’t been able to reach him Seems like a bunch of BS  
My account is set for automatic payment on the th of each month I a reminder about days prior My reminder showed about a increase I called and spoke with Eric The only explanation he had was because of healthcare rise in Texas Eric then offered me a defensive driving course to reduce my payment Fire the gecko lizard and then maybe humans afford the I have no tickets or accidents for years I have multiple insured and a Sr citizen None of that matters to reduce my payment seriously searching for other 
 I have never had such a horrible experience with an company For the past five years I had through a different company and my now year old daughter had hers through I decided to give a shot myself because I heard nothing but good things about it and I wanted us to be on the same policy Little did I know I was wrong I bought Auto on after doing the quotes online and I my reference number I spent two hours on the phone with three different representatives Less than hours later on changed my plan without consulting me whatsoever They increased my annual rate that I had already signed up for the day before with an additional I called them as soon as I saw the absurd change I spoke with a representative who help me so I asked to speak with the department manager His explanation was that the representatives all three of them made a mistake with my purchase Then I asked him what about the online quote and my reference number and he explained to me that he know and that it is probably   a program mistake   Additionally he was very rude and sounded like he care about his customers satisfaction He sounded completely uninterested in helping and he wait to off the phone I cannot believe how much time that I have and effort I spent trying to find the best and the cheapest deal for my daughter and I to be treated like that It is unbelievable to me

 In I was in a hit and run accident of a person who ran into the side of my I the person information and name but he left the scene so I turned it in and accepted my claim because I had Uninsured Motorist on my Policy Then like a couple of months later I was in a hit and run where a person was over and knocked me off the road and kept going Well my fixed but then they pay me for the injuries that my children and I sustained in the wreck They made me do a EUO Examination Under Oath and then shortly after that they denied my claim and also dropped me It has been a couple of years since my wreck and I tried to with because I was not at fault and I help that when the person hit me I any information But the representative that I called stated that ever insure me as long as I live This is not fair and what are we paying for for when your is making you out to be a person who makes false claims I was in hit and runs The adjusters lied and made it seem like I caused damage to my I do that and hurt myself and my two children This is horrible and also they have it now where my premiums are outrageous with other carriers is a horrible company to be insured through  
 Rudest possible stone walling phone call ever Ask a direct question about my privacy has NO ANSWER Ask Again no answer They want to charge me additional money for something that they MADE UP UNHAPPY  
 I was recently rear ended by a customer She was issued a ticket for careless driving and I was not cited My statement the police report and the evidence shows her fault but she is lying to and they won’t accept responsibility is a joke anyone see the facts Her story is physically impossible to have happened I thought lying to your company was illegal seems to encourage it It’s been over weeks since the accident I guess a court fight is next  
 I had an accident due to hydroplaning and the hit a divider after slipping two lanes The front of the was damaged which included the engine The air bag popped out and the was in a bad shape When I called up it that due to a 'photo inspection' that I do before the accident it stopped the collision coverage two weeks prior to the accident and it not cover the expenses It took days for to tell me their decision All these days my was towed and kept in a workshop even pay the towing or storage for those days about dollars forget about the total expense of the repair about dollars Was extremely dissatisfied with service and switched to ** and now saving about dollars month  
 I signed up for classic on the website but when I needed to file a claim they say I do not have classic but liability only and they not pay anything not even for the tow which the officer on site had stated   with the report number and his ID number” the would pay to tow to the lot from the accident site This was a much more expensive tow than towing to my home mile away not to mention weekend storage fees Basically if I sign up for classic on the website why is it not on my policy Or was it conveniently removed after I filed a claim I only know they say it is not there and not pay = bad faith Don’t waste your money  
 After I called and ask them a question they cancelled my It was a question and they had no right to cancel my collision If I had remained anonymous that would have been the best thing to do They have made a total ** of themselves and I company They have a very bad attitude but what you expect they deal with the government They seem to care about the people Go figure I am having my attorney look at what they did for what worth who knows All I say is years old and never had an company like this I would tell anybody   Do not use     
 I was recently in an accident which totaled my While I am not insured thank god the other driver who was at fault is Although I had a detailed police report and several witnesses stating the other driver's guilt refused to accept % liability and then dragged my claim out for MONTHS Their claims reps adjusters were rude argumentative and flat out ignored my calls I placed several calls to supervisors and was never called back The service is absolutely terrible making this the most frustrating process As a result I now have to sue the other driver to cover the remaining total of my after being forced to settle for only a portion is terrible with customer service I hope I NEVER have to deal with again  
 After a call from stating that there is a licensed driver living in my home that I needed to add to my policy or that they would have to drop my policy I started asking questions and the name that they gave me was that of my father that passed away in Sept of We are now in They could not explain but only apologize and tell me to ignore any letters from them that it was all a mistake Three months later I a letter from Tallahassee stating that my license are suspended due to no I call and they once again want to know who the license driver that is living in my home I have been living alone for over four years which means I live alone and they only apologize and offer to reinstate my policy for almost four hundred dollars I lost all respect for that little lizard I believe that I left State farm after eleven years for this ** all for cheaper rates  
 I had the worst experience with with trying to process a new policy minutes bulls hours and ended up having to cancel the policy because I could not meet the midnight deadline of e signing their forms because their systems were down Not an error on my end theirs but I penalized and forced to stay up I have never been treated so poorly by customer service reps who contradicted each other and expected me to stay up to midnight and then to find out from the last supervisor I spoke with Kristen that they wanted me to print and fax the forms by midnight pm Tell me all do you have a fax machine DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD SAYS THEY ARE AWFUL  
 I wanted to change the date my payment was due I started the process online During the process the website that I would need to make two payment to be able to change the date At that point I called and talked to a representative who promised me multiple times that I would NOT have to make a double payment When that months payment posted it was for a single payment But the next month took TWO payments out of my account with no notice and without my permission I called and they me that they could not reimburse the money but that I would have to go to my bank and file a complaint with them to my money back The money was finally returned and I thought all was well In December they only withdrew payment then in January double dipped in my account again I again called and demanded all of my money back two payments and to cancel my account Again they me I had to file a complaint with my bank I did file the complaint and my money back again Both times double dipped they overdrafted my account Both times I had to put other bills on hold Since I them to cancel my account and refund my money they have sent me multiple bills for over company are crooks I never use them again and I recommend anyone else to either  
 I was in an accident where a county dump truck plow pulled out in front of me turning left and I fishtailed my driver's side of my truck into him I was not at fault I made the claim hours after the accident and they were very kind and informative with me Now been days and I have no idea what is on I a crabby lady on the phone who me   when we have new information we contact you    called my adjuster a million times with no answer literally no answer after calling multiple times every day for a week I him on the phone time when he called me leave voicemails and emails and he call once and leave a voicemail to call him back but he does not answer his dang phone still waiting to hear back and see how much I for my totaled truck I kind of need the money to a diff truck and pay off the totaled one I understand things take time but it takes a lot longer when you in contact with the people who are supposed to be serving you Do Not I be switching my coverage as soon as this claim is finished with had better service at a drive thru  
 History My wife and I have been insured by for the past years for our Our homeowners was originally through Travelers Co since years and I recently became aware is under writed by Every months would raise the premium of our by % I sold my truck a couple of years ago as I have a company and for the past years we have only insured my wife's SUV a Honda Pilot and the premium recently jumped to months Our home owners policy was annually with a deductible Last month I ran into an old friend who runs a local agency I now have auto for per year with identical coverage as and home owners for per year with a deductible Long Story Short if you have you are paying for their millions of dollars in advertisements and you need to find a local agency who save you a lot of money 
 My son was riding with friend and they had a crash The driver had concussion and know where or who he was My son had neck injury and severe back pain etc Common injuries from wreck and both were taken to emergency room immediately The driver has and we contacted them and we were “WE DON’T COVER PASSENGERS IN THE ” What never heard that My son’s bills are huge and continued therapy etc They say “WE WON’T COVER IT BECAUSE DRIVER AS INJURED AS MY SON ” What do I do now We know the parents family of driver and they are making it with their children bills etc No way could we sue them had been their company for years and they never had problem till this wreck What exactly are they paying for This happened in Alabama and I don’t think law is so differ from other states regarding this Also I called pretending to want it and asked about quote etc after I their response earlier and asked does it cover my passengers and I was rewarded with a YES Now I thanked them and hung up more confused are they lying are they denying my son Next step lawyer I need to contact me Asap  
 In August of this year I was sandwiched between other on a Phoenix freeway The driver in front of me had stopped suddenly then I stopped and was impacted from behind at about mph pushing me into the in front The only severe damage incurred was to my which unfortunately was totaled and the airbag deployed I received no citation and the Arizona accident report clearly showed that the driver that impacted me at mph was at fault she received a ticket Ironically that driver was also insured by But did not want to hear the result of any state issued accident report They determined that it was entirely my fault and though my actual damages were was totaled according to their estimator they somehow decided that a check for would suffice Several letters have transpired back and forth and they still refuse to honor their obligation What is almost as horrific and incredulous is that they somehow managed to taint my driving record as showing me at fault in this accident I asked representative how they managed to slander my driving record when the State of Arizona shows no fault on my behalf The representative stated   We decide who is at fault not the State of Arizona    UNBELIEVABLE COMMENT AND ATTITUDE  
 My husband and I have been customers of for years In those years we've filed a few claims fully covered affordably gone through college married started a family and even lived in the Silicon Valley We have been satisfied with their service and rates until recently when we relocated out of state and our rates for covering ONLY went up to month We paying that for full coverage on After talking to them there was ABSOLUTELY nothing they could do and I feel their rep even try to keep our business The reason our rates went so high was   the cost of doing business in our new location is higher    Needless to say we are done doing business with them and seeking elsewhere considering their   customer loyalty   values  
 I had an accident recently where I was hit by a big in the back and pushed into a in front of me Both back bumper and front had damages and the shifter broke After review the adjuster assigned to my offered to go ahead with the repairs charging a reduced deductible if I chose not to fix the front bumper Then she the front bumper was patched from inside and I may be hiding damage I think even the most professional experts would hide damage behind a bumper That was outright ridiculous and offensive because she   people declare damages   I was already infuriated with this Then she tells me that the is really low on fluids and the accident had nothing to do with the lack of fluids I distinctly remember some fluid under the after the accident After I escalated to the adjuster's manager they they would fix the front bumper and the so called accusation that I had actually patched the front bumper was taken back but I would have to pay the full deductible The supervisor offered to me to pour for free the fluids into the where they were depleted as long as I bought them fair game When I thought the pain was over the same lousy adjuster calls me a day before my was due to be delivered and basically threatens me to the fluids ASAP else have to pay out of pocket for the rental that gave me I mean who the ** does she think she is Talking with a courteous tone but saying awful and offensive things change the fact that nasty I am really surprised that hires such spineless and incompetent people For a customer that carries top coverages on luxury for over years it is extremely offensive to be treated this way I have almost made up my mind about taking my business to company that knows how to treat customers with respect Also if there are any fluid related complaints in the next few months I have all of the evidence to suggest foul play at this body shop and the specific adjuster proudly says nation's best and I seriously doubt it We all know companies are here to make profit but you pay an company so they continue to charge and blame you And by the way I am responsible for the entire deductible even though someone hit me and ran GREAT Isn’t it I am writing this review so do the due diligence with my claim and most importantly discipline this adjustor I really hope she ruin someone else's experience working with  
 When I first joined I the representative my husband is in the military and would be leaving in a month and I wanted to have him as a driver since he still drives our but wanted to exclude him once he leaves for deployment for months Our policy ends in months so I figured I save money and lower payments by excluding him from the policy which made sense to me I was this was possible and   could do anytime    A month passed after countless calls with different representatives and given the run around and   wrong paperwork sent to me their error    I ended up canceling my policy Each representatives had given me wrong information First I was it was possible sent me paperwork to sign and fax faxed and found out it was the wrong form representative sent me the right form and me my husband needed to sign the form and after faxing I was they needed my signature instead So I fax the right form with my signature and my husband's signature to avoid any other mix up and found out this was the wrong form Again I was emailed the   right   form and so I sent it over and found out this was not even possible to do and that my premium would remain the same I finally had it so I canceled my policy Beware what you are if it is not in writing agents change up on you QUICK  
 Our son is from Kansas and we live in Arkansas He came down to buy a brand new Chevrolet Silverado He needed to complete the transaction Long story short he was charged for which included the first month only They him the extra was to be used toward a payment if he missed one He had absolutely no choice but to pay the entire because he had to back to Kansas for work He drove down and back to Kansas in the same day hr round trip I feel due to his circumstance that he was very much taken advantage of  
I watched a guy throw open his door and door ding my BRAND NEW Watched the whole thing happen and would still not pay for the damages even have plates on it yet it was so new Wasted my whole Thanksgiving Weekend taking all their photos they required and they come back and tell me its not possible the guy did it yet I was standing in front of both watching the whole thing happen Horrible service and would never recommend them to anyone and hope to god you never in an accident with someone who has this Crappy Crappy

  had me pay MORE to have collision coverage BECAUSE I had collision coverage with a deductible I could not benefit from my uninsured motorist coverage that would have me pay to repair my front bumper when someone backed up into it I paid them every month for years I call that day to report an incident and am I have to pay dollars so I cancelled my policy that day but not after the incident was recorded in the national database which means I would have no way to any sort of coverage for this from now on I am so angry right now DO NOT give any money to this company I wish I had known If you are reading this then you know

Engine damage made clear upon every contact with Agent called twice Photos of damage clearly show oil on ground Oil everywhere with burnt oil on grill Sent emails and repair shop has left messages twice at shop for days with only response about body damage I should have looked at ratings buy different now 
I called to report a small dent in my from an accident They sent out an adjuster and he gave me a quote of and a deductible check He me to call him if I cash the check I found someone who could do the work for I called the adjuster and him I ripped up the check as he instructed put on my record that I used the check and I was % negligent I never used for the dent and repair only to a quote The only way I knew still had on their records that I cashed the check and was % negligent was because I decided to quote from an agency and they could see on my records that indeed I did file a claim with This was FALSE kept it on my records so that they could justify raising my rate may have lower rates BUT THERE IS A REASON WAY Buyer Beware 
 My automatic payment is set up to be automatically deducted from my debit card on the th of each However this still being November took out on November nd and also again on November rd This was two payments they deducted from my account When I contacted them on Sunday and again on Monday all they could do was apologize for the error and would credit of the payments back to my account However they this process take up to days When I explained to them that I be able to my groceries for Thanksgiving they care Thank You for ruining what could be my last Thanksgiving Shopping around now for company for my auto care that I have been a very loyal customer of theirs for many years and I have NEVER filed any type of claim recommend to anyone  
 I was in an accident at am leaving account from account as I am a business owner A young boy hit my when I was in a gas station My adjuster accepted liability when we did everything we were suppose to do legally They reverse their decision They they based it on google maps and recorded statements My attorney listened to the statements and nothing suggested liability in our part Now saying there is nothing I do So now I have permanent damage and always have headaches and neck pains the rest of my life Which is not good for my business which I own a commercial and residential cleaning business I hate this company and recommend them to anyone  
 I called for road assistance They me someone be there within an hour I called times the number they gave me every time I was in mins someone should be there No came been hours I them I had to go somewhere and very important No came till hours Shame on their service They were not even Sorry for this  
 A disgusting company A client hit my I sustained minor medical injuries confirmed and documented by a medical professional basic fender damage and yet I am still having to fight for what is legally and rightfully due to me Even after the company accepted liability the adjuster working on my case has lied to me on the record me I should give up the case on more than occasion spent over a month drawing this whole situation out and illegally further pressured me into using a facility to repair the damages by stating that if I use their facility I be denied the full use of a rental for the amount of time it takes to my fixed When I in to see my doctor the conclusion was that the shock of the impact caused my back to spasm and there was some minor tenderness on my spine from the force of the hit Nothing that I heal from and nothing long term I reported my doctors findings to the claims adjuster assigned to me as requested and was none my injuries were possible even with documented medical opinions and proof We finally settled for a minimal amount which I was happy to accept since all I was asking for was coverage of my doctors visit and the subsequent x ray taken to make sure all was well but two weeks later received a contradictory letter revoking all this All this after a body shop denied me the appropriate amount recommended by my dealerships' accredited body shop to my fixed correctly and for the long term I honestly cannot believe a company and employee would engage in victim shaming when they themselves admit to their client hitting my and yet their actions are undeniable and intolerable Because the accident and injuries resulted in basic fender bender damage for me and no damage for their client whatsoever they are trying to sweep my case under the rug not trying to sue them Merely trying to the necessary amount needed to cover an accident I was the victim of And as I before I have been on more than occasion I should drop my claim by the adjuster assigned to me I want the basic necessities afforded to me as a safe driver with a clean record who was hit by their client The denial of all this leaves me with only conclusion is a disgusting company  
 I been with for over two years and never file A claim few months ago my two damaged by vandalism and the other stolen so I file my first claim with took my information and passed my complaint to the claim department They call me saying     worry we help you    then sent the adjuster then sent me an   investigator   who started to investigate me about what happen to my asking me personal questions recording me ETC He totally made me feel like a criminal instead of a victim of what actually happen to me He made a few interviews phone calls to my relatives asking if I was good person etc Anyway till now they have not resolved my claims and still waiting on a response Hope this review helps people to think twice before insuring their with this company You may save money like their commercial says but at the end if you file a claim this may be your worst headache you ever had I never recommend this company to anyone ever ever We have something in Spanish that says   Lo barato sale caro     what is cheap becomes expensive at the end   Very true  
 We had been with for years and never had an incident to report even when our bumper had been scraped in a parking lot multiple occasions We recently bought a new and insured it as we had done with our other When the policy arrived I noticed I had not added Uninsured Motorist so I hopped on the site and added it in Oct days later I noticed a ding in my door where had opened their door into it I took pictures and reported it and this is where it all went downhill Right off the bat the first question was about the damage and when it occurred I explained that it was in a parking lot parked far out to avoid this type of thing The next question was about the addition of UM and what prompted us to add it and I explained The entire process seemed more focused on whether this was previous damage or not and if I was trying to scam them for the damage Problem with their assumption is that the day after I added the coverage I had taken a picture of my kids dressed for Halloween in front of the and the damage is not there they had this picture on day one Secondly the damage was a total of and after a deductible they would be out which they would be able to make up with my next month's premium What it eventually came down to almost weeks later was a final conversation with the investigator He asked if I had asked any of the businesses near where I was parked if they had security footage of the incident and they also wanted a receipt confirming I was where I I was along with the information of anyone who could corroborate my story At that point I him   I am asking for my to be fixed it cost your company not If you do this I pay for the repair myself find an company who is more customer friendly and cancel my policy with you    He then started to go into his job description and why he is being so thorough at which point I interrupted and him   There's my answer thank you   With the refund I received from I only be out of pocket  
 I do not in anyway recommend this company nor I ever do business with them again I had these guys for like plus years and paid them and was loyal to them Well I paid a month for a brand new evo which was fair price considering it was a new fast Well life was had bad news for me and I lost my job and no longer had a income Well I contacted them to work things out and they they could not do anything So after I sold everything I owned I gathered up enough money for more and payment so that I may my self through truck school Well at the end of that month my was ending and I contacted them to see again if there was ANYTHING they could do and they no I then asked them if I would lose my good standing and be able to pick up as soon as I my next paycheck They yes and that everything would be fine Well again life favor me and I barely made enough to live off of so I had to let my go and so I have a Well after some months I finally started to back on my feet and I was able to go buy a Well I was trying to a jeep grand Cherokee for k I was happy to call them and my good service back Well after they ran numbers they gave me a quote of a month I was like WHAT how was that even possible I was paying that for a new months ago They   Well you had for some time    I was like no ** how do you have when you have a ** It is SOOO stupid that they are to do that to me after I was loyal to them I screw this company if to screwed I might as well go it by some other company that I loyal to Well my wife behind month on her payment after years of loyalty and they that it would cost her to again more than what she was paying Man you have to love how this company treats the people that made it what it is Fyi I nor my wife have any accidents or tickets So all in all I hate and I NEVER deal with them again after the way they treated us  
 On July my husband month old daughter and myself were on vacation in Myrtle Beach SC when we were hit in the side of our Chevy Blazer We were through an intersection and a making a left turn hit us in the drivers side door area totaling our Tickets were given to the other driver and none to us We were taken to the hospital by ambulance for our injuries and treated I have not hired an attorney because it was not our fault and I thought we would be treated better than we have has on separate occasions threatened to close our case claiming that they never received information The claims examiner Ms Toni ** has promised to contact me back within a certain time frame and has not done so I have turned all receipts and medical bills into them as soon as received and still I am treated poorly I want to hire an attorney in this case but feel that is the only way to be treated fairly I hope someone help me  
 I had for year but never had to claim anything till today charged me last month and this month for my My dodge dart was hit in a parking lot of a park&ride but I see the other The damage is the side and the bumper cracked off and bent and big scrapes on the paint The police come out I called would not do the claim saying the was not on the policy days ago but I have proof it was covered and I was charged a bill for it made an excuse to not give me the amount of the claim when my deductible was for damage on my dart says they need investigation as to why the dart was not added days ago but I already paid the bill and have proof the was covered on my policy was rude on the phone and using excuses not to file my claim As a result I them I not tolerate this because I had other companies never use a false excuse not to file a claim  
 I have been a Auto policyholder for many years I had chosen because they seemed to have the best prices for coverage offered Coverage means nothing if you cannot use it I had purchased full coverage for my several years ago I have not had any accidents till last year when someone rear ended my the driver had thankfully His accepted full responsibility for the damage as I was by The call center reps are all very kind and helpful but once you have to deal with employees directly that ALL Change My first contact was with an adjuster who took the physical report on the damage after my first accident was extremely difficult and has a very unhappy disposition Even though would not be paying for the damage the claims adjuster was extremely difficult to work with and not helpful at all each contact with him became increasingly challenging wants you to have any work done to at of their contracted services centers and if you do not want to utilize them I found that suddenly stops all assistance with your damage and support of your claim Now flash forward year later after my is completely repaired My is vandalized while parked on the street in front of my house Now this time treats me like a criminal when I report the incident Investigations and interrogations as if I had committed a heinous crime The investigator for reads me my rights and asks me to provide my statement under oath while being recorded Seriously this happened and I have it all electronically recorded Since when did become law enforcement agents So knowing what I do about this ridiculous and insulting situation I decide to record the investigator as well He made several errors in his investigative interview of myself so of course I had to correct him numerous times due to his facts confused and his line of questioning having little cohesiveness He kept trying to tell me that the damage to my occurred during separate incidents How would he know this unless he was the that did the crime And lets not forget this either why would I damage my newly repaired and have to go through this arduous process again Regardless here is the issue with If you pay for certain types of coverage be well aware they not honor their end of the deal if they have to pay out for the damage themselves even if they are not the responsible party they not treat you well at all Add Insult to Injury and this is what you from The Company You be left to prove your innocence as if you are a hardened criminal and of course left feeling like you have been injured not Once but Twice after working with This has been a disgusting process and I certainly continue to broadcast the issue so others not be tricked into thinking they be what they pay thousands of dollars for when signing up for a Policy  
 I submitted two towing bills to claims service I was it would take three weeks took almost two months to send payment and then only paid of the two tow bills This is totally unsatisfactory and the worst claims service I have ever had in over fifty years of driving You must pay them every month on the exact day and on time yet they pay you in an untimely manner and and then nickle and dime you to death I would say to anyone thinking of cause you've seen their TV ads to go elsewhere to buy Their claims service sucks from a company that provides good customer service AND JACK THEIR CUSTOMERS AROUND  
  quoted me a mo They asked me if I had any damage on my I them   just a little dent on the driver side    It went up to and the rep you are still saving money How is from to saving I should of nothing to those ripoffs  
 I tried to obtain a non owner's auto policy for a rented but the circumstances leading to this request were misunderstood by the agent who erroneously recorded misinformation into my record Subsequently my existing owner's policy was terminated and a new non owner's auto policy was denied based on the faulty information that had been recorded Consequently I was left without on a rented Attempts to try to correct the record prompted the agent to accuse me of changing my story The agent further curtailed any further explanations by inserting her own misdirected scenarios and frequently misquoted me The entire experience was not only agonizing but time consuming The disrespect was mind boggling All the advertising in the world not undo the damage that agents are unleashing on their customer base  
 The automation kept sending me to the billing department to pay my bill and the billing department rep kept sending me to automation I felt like I was on a merry go round Woman take my payment so I go on with my life Train your employees  
 I am at utter disgust with your company I have to tell you that I was with your company since I was in the Army and not that the company I left was the my mother worked for Back then I had faith You treated me well Always there when we needed you When my was broken into in the middle of November in while I was pregnant they took the entire stereo compartment including the heat controls That was fixed and ready in not even two days I have to say I was blown away During this battle my ex decided to kick me off my with I did not know this So here I am driving around with no and my children in the If he would have me I would have been able to handle it Finally I found out when I went to change my information on my truck I didn’t any notice or call or anything from anyone I called and was speaking to a young lady on the phone this was in November of last year beginning to middle time frame I explained my whole situation to her While she sounded like she actually cared it was a complete fake attitude I begged for help and not know anything I my started with you people I asked her if LOYALTY counts for anything She asked why For some reason it doesn’t show that I was with since The reason I stayed that long was because I had my faith in this company I am completely disappointed in the treatment I received from your company Not this either When I initially called to fix my own information and where I am living now I had asked the customer service rep about times “Are you sure this is all I need for my on my truck because it is still financed ” All three times they yes Not shortly after that I a bill from my finance company stating that there wasn’t enough coverage and I had an astronomical amount of fees added to my bill Trying to figure out what to do to help I call you people Well that was a mistake and I should have known better However I still gave your company my trust and NOWHERE I asked time and time again “What else is there anything else I do ” All I was Nope nope nope You see you all didn’t care I was with your company for over years I had faith in you to take care of my and my valuable cargo my children in it YOU ALL FAILED ME I didn’t want to change companies but due to my finances I had to With the insane amount you wanted each month I would not have money for anything else So I canceled There is no excuse for your company’s behavior NONE I was loyal to you and I trusted you You all didn’t care what I had on to me that was ‘give me money’ I don’t need any darn hand holding what I wanted was a little help But NOPE Not even a hesitation or a supervisor on the line NOTHING Now you send me to collections for something that your company screwed up on and gave me the wrong plan I had to pay my finance company the fees for because your staff had no idea what to do They didn’t even want to try This is inexcusable and I be sure to let everyone I know read this letter and know how I feel I USED to speak highly of you USED TO Since you have sent me to collections I pay the remainder of the bill in monthly payments that your company is to have to live with I don’t care if you feel that isn’t enough Your customer service wasn’t even close dollars a month and not a penny more You do not deserve the urgency that I did not receive when I needed your company the most I hope your company decides to change their ways At point it was great I loved Sorry but my faith in your company is gone completely I have other about this situation and I continue to inform them of your company’s actions If you have questions and need to call me you contact me at **  
 One night driving back to my home guy hit my on the back when he was trying to change lane to my lane I claimed the with guy's company which is and I did also had the with Now already been days of claim this company does not care about my situation and keep inspecting the issue It be seen clearly by looking at my that it was his fault but they even bother to come to see the Also when I tried to call agent who is looking after the incident she pick up the call instead calls back later and says me that calling to them solve the issue faster Now truly I have choice rather than to stay and finish them their inspection Only because other guy is lying about the situation I am in headache and they keep telling me to claim through my own when it is not my mistake At least they come see the and find out how the was hit because the way my is hit shows clearly that it was his fault  
 On June I was side swiped by driver has found me guilty even after my appeal Police Officer ** wrote I stated I was merging into the left lane causing the accident I submitted pictures that clearly show I am proceeding straight and the other driver was merging into my lane thus causing the accident Driver stated she was proceeding straight which is a lie and be disproved by the photos taken however I am at fault because the officer wrote incorrect information I asked Officer ** to amend his statement and he stated was not amending because I I was merging I stated she was on her cell phone however a citation was not issued and he had no comment I am disappointed in they have found me guilty without examining all evidence presented They have played judge jury and executioner if you preside in front of the Judge you present all evidence proof of your innocence a picture should speak a thousand words why was mine ignored I wrote a detailed step by step driving instruction once you exit the Holland Tunnel entering New Jersey Submitting further proof pictures as to WHY there is no need for me to merge into lane ALL of my information and evidence was ignored Because ignored my proof and has not reviewed the evidence provided I have given them a bad rating This is my nd year with and I NOT COMPLETE the year I do not need to be part of an organization that does not defend its clientele and look at all evidence presented I have never been the cause of an accident and hope I never am  
Currently is unwilling to properly cover a claim that is ongoing and no amount of communication with them resolve the issue I keep the line that they were unable to view the damage but based off of their current slant even if all the stars would have aligned they still would have denied it
 On Sept th my husband and I were driving home from a concert in Phoenix City We were stopped at a red light and were hit from behind from a client of My husband gets out of the to speak with the driver who states not to call the police because this is his her mother's He she points to his her mother in the passenger seat I tell him that I work for State Farm and that I have to call the police as the that driving is actually my brother in law's He says some nasty words to his mom stating that if I call the cops he's to jail he had been drinking and driving after leaving a downtown concert As I am calling the cops he leaves the scene I was able to the tag number and gave a full description of the to the cops I made the claim with after I was able to pick up my police report and was that until they speak with their insured they do anything to help me Obviously these people are real stand up people as they left the scene of an accident The claims agent tells me several times that she placed blame on her insured because she ahold of them After weeks of back and forth conversations she tells me that they pay for our damages because they ahold of their insured and she's closing the case She also me that I could have made up their license plate number Really It was a Chevy Lumina Why would anyone do that The claims agent was Rachel ** and I sent her everything that she needed to see that they were clearly at fault They never even tried to avoid hitting me Now here it is over a month later and the case is closed but am still actively after them for damages  
 Unfortunately I was involved in an accident However the most unfortunate part was having to deal with The claims adjuster was ok but the damage adjuster Betsie ** was terrible I was the damage adjuster was there to ensure my BMW was repaired with the utmost quality and done in a timely manner My was delayed times for a total of extra days weeks total Not once did I receive a call from her or an explanation I spoke to her supervisor Michael ** and was assured by him that he would personally go to the shop and ensure that everything was being done correctly and that my would be returned to me in perfect   safe   condition Never heard back from him Had the same conversation with him times Still never heard back from him The auto damage adjusters are useless and stroke you the entire time they did nothing except waste my time trying to ask them to do their jobs I % go back to Mercury as this was such a waste of time and money  
 I have had to call in times this month First off I have been with them for year and never had auto pay come out of my account Second when I was asked I no to the customer service rep then no times to an automated service Then they took the money out of my account unexpectedly So I called back in that day and they closed my account when asking for the automated payment to be removed Then I call back in and they fix that and send me a second bill and a cancellation notice if it is not paid So once again I have to call in and I make arrangements to pay by the th of the next month and they send me cancellation notice for the rd of the next month so I call in again This time   it has to be by the rd or it close your policy    I might of missed some stuff here but basically I have not even had to call a cellular provider a cable company or any other company this many times in a month ever in my life Needless to say I am gone no questions asked I do not work with garbage customer service like this ever I deserve better I tried to file a complaint and was there was nothing I could do nor a lawyer could do for me  
 I stuck on the Bronx River Parkway in the rain and would not come me I did not have road side assistance when I specifically sat on the phone for over an hour adding it to my coverage They also stated they cannot come me because a rule forbidden to go on the parkway The outcome I’m changing companies every insured person I know have issues with them They want your money for lack of service They have money to promote on television but no money to provide service to their clients  
 My FLH Shovelhead was stolen says send pics gives price as We disagree and we are to find ads in our part of the country which is Central CA Nada and Kelly Blue Book they accept high low We send in more ads They say is ok but accept because ad says showroom condition I a appraisal from a Prior owner of a Harley dealership for over yrs and once owned the bike and his appraisal is They back to us and say they raised the condition from fair to excellent and that they added to the payoff This brings the total to We a letter from them stating how they arrived at that # and they are from ads in Texas We live in CA We have rejected this offer also I paid for this bike Something feel right about the way they are handling this claim What should I do  
 does not care about their customers and they not take care of you They tell you lies and make empty promises They are the worst company EVER They should be shut down 
 Very poor service No wonder why they give such a cheap rate They never want to pay out claims They treat their customers as criminals when it is a time to pay claims They use customer premiums in advertising not to pay claims No in this country beat their price but is it worth it Is my really have a full coverage  
 Cheap probably the reason we a cheap service switch to State Farm Worst service ever into accident luckily not my fault State Farm took care of everything from repair to rental  
 First I made a payment two days late out of my account and they since payment was returned our policy was in cancellation even though they still received their payment The supervisor there was nothing they could do to change that and that we had to pay dollars more for a return Then the next payment comes and they take the payment out of the wrong account my account keep in mind our automatic payments have never come out of this account Then I an email that our policy has been cancelled I called and talk to a supervisor who that they were really sorry but we need to pay to restart our policy and pay more each payment I this was their fault and we wanted the policy turned back on to the way it was She sorry and wanted to know if we wanted to pay with debit or credit They were unable to produce a recording of my conversation prior to verify if in fact the right account was verified She also that they always verify accounts I her our automatic payments have always come out of my husband's account not mine It interesting that they say this   call is being record   but they magically find this one Also they had no notes saying I wanted to change our automatic payments So they   sorry about the mix up and we would like to your policy restarted   This is such poor customer care When I asked them to speak to someone higher up she me she was the highest person and there was nothing she could do  
 Making a claim easy Friendly recorded it all SMOOTH SAILING No estimator in my area a little harder to work out but the tow company was paid by OKAY Having my adjuster call me back a joke She would call at am and not leave a voice mail I am working and unable to answer my phone I call her back and she is unavailable every time Asked for to contact the AT FAULT driver to cover my deductible says it is   not their place   and tells me to do it FINE I do it But you want to make YOUR customer happy As long as gets its why they an company call company to talk No seems to have any direction there I typically do not rant but this has been a stressful H E A D A C H E all because some idiot want to wait seconds while a made a left hand turn  
 I am sad to say that I have to write such a raunchy review on but I am appalled at how unprofessional they handle their claims I was recently involved or I should say I witness to a woman that lost control of her motorcycle in front of my near my local grocery store I willingly helped her up and asked her if she needed any assistance She no she was fine a little shaken up from falling off her bike There was no EMT or police at the scene because there was never an actually collision made between the two of us but of the store security guards from the store asked to take a statement So I gave the woman my card in case I needed to for contact purposes and she filed a FALSE CLAIM against me About a week later I received a phone call from a man with He took my statement and as well as my wife's statement and we never heard anything back from them So when I received a collection notice in the mail for I assure you I was livid never contacted me back after the statement I made and sent me a collection notice in the mail saying that I owed them money from a claim that was made against me They paid the woman who fell off her bike and expected me to pay for her clumsy accident I am ashamed that such a big company like would Fraudulently give her money and not follow through with a comprehensive investigation and expect me an innocent bystander to pay for her own lousy mistake is a fraud  
 When I recently took my vandalized into the corporation approved body shop I expected good service Little did I know after four weeks of dealing with the satisfaction guaranteed body shop and the on site corporation employee and returning six times to the body shop they finally it right The destroyed side view mirrors were replaced twice with used sun damaged mirrors then finally with new mirrors The body shop guy he did not see the bad mirrors Both of these guys also missed the five small dents must have been the vandals fist prints and the broken front light The body shop guy he did not see the five roof dents Later it finally occurred to me that the corporation representative existed to work with the body shop guy to see how much they could fool me During early return visit I to the guy   Funny thing about retired people They keep coming back until you it right   He laughed Little did I know that he was to keep me coming back If they think you work for a living and that you are too busy to complain they do it to you  
 Had a claim due to driver damaging my I had to drive to a claims facility to an estimate During the estimate the adjuster strongly suggestion I use their repair facility I wanted to use a different repair facility where I had great service in the past After taking my to my choice kept them waiting for days to approve additional damage found when parts were removed for the repair My repair facility me did not respond until the third contact The damage to my involved the front bumper and grill This was supposed to be a day repair Because of it was almost weeks before my was repaired and returned to me I assume that this was a punishment for me wanting to use my own repair facility This is not a good way to do business  
 Why replace year old's wheelchair Drew ** is a year old with cerebral palsy Last month he was attempting to cross the street in the crosswalk when he was hit by a Thankfully he is okay but his wheelchair was completely destroyed Now his company is refusing to replace it This is PATHETIC  
 My had to accidents The damage was severe Worth totaling the I had done several days of rental also My case was reviewed by several people in different states I was never paid for my rental total loss and nothing was paid Every time the time to settle the case some excuse was given not to pay My worth of they paid almost nothing and now I have worth of debt and I have to file bankruptcy Useless worthless adjusters and all  
 My husband and I were policyholders with for over years We decided to a new policy with Esurance due to increasing our rate to almost double what we were paying for an accident resulting in a loss of less than Our premium with for the month of August was paid in full and requested the coverage start on August with Esurance I still wanted to really keep but the premium was too expensive My husband and I had discussed separating due to personal reasons and I wondered what the premium would be if I kept the and he went with Esurance should we separate I had not cancelled our policy at this point since I still needed to the coverage until the end of the month and I had already paid it I called to asked a HYPOTHETICAL question and wanted a simple QUOTE and the LICENSED AGENT IDIOT on the phone took it upon herself to instead of quote me she went ahead and separated and wrote two different policies I wanted to know IF my husband and I were to separate what the rates for each of us would be While it had been discussed we were not and did not separate If we were separated why would I have my mail and his mail come to the same address I did not realize this hanging up the phone with the agent I thought I had simply made a quote A week later I a bill from I had already paid the premium for August I checked out bank account the payment had cleared I did not think anything about it We started a new policy with Esurance and on I cancelled OUR policy Well at least the that I knew existed A month later I a bill in the mail for non payment cancellation from Now they want me to pay for coverage on a policy from that I never asked for or never knew existed I had already paid for coverage for the month of August on our old policy before she separated the into separate policies So they should actually owe us a refund for the last week of August since is pre paid and I cancelled the original policy on I have called customer service and spoke to two different supervisors and they refuse to do anything about it They tell me to pay the premium for my for RIPOFF And FRAUD  
  conspired with the Mercedes Greenway Dealership not to repair my SL as per policy standards This is the worst case of fraud anyone imagine I have written proof of lame reasons used not to pay for related damages on my I am seeking damages has denied all supplements thereafter and my remains un drivable  
 I call the adjuster in my claim because I want to know what they paid to who and the adjuster refused to give information about it Really my policy my benefits and I have rights  
 Filing the claim was super easy claim center always answered my calls and were very polite and helpful Accident was hit and run not at fault full converge ruled a total loss was fully paid off clean title no dmv tickets Makes you think it would be rather easy to the check from WRONG on a month and still dealing with the adjuster They give you the line that they return your call within two hours on two days since I last left a message with the adjuster And still no call Run from this company Like I earlier the claims process was super easy Dealing with the adjuster now that is a nightmare rather kicked in the balls twice and take % of what they offered me than deal with these guys Forget water boarding send a claims adjuster to Gitmo New strategy for dealing with Isis send after them They'll be begging to surrender Run from this company people You what you pay for with  
 I was involved in an accident in May with of their insured and to this our case has not been settled P L has the worst attitude to be a adjuster We have to call her and when you call she is always NASTY My advice is anytime you are involved in a automobile accident with of their insured an attorney ASAP Do not deal with them they try to pay less as possible I even a policy with them AWFUL  
 My was repaired and a series of issues ensued First the headlight was replaced with an aftermarket headlight that was not KAPPA approved When I went to have the bulb replaced since they put in the wrong bulb the entire headlight had to be removed so all the trim and molding had to be removed and put back in after the repair The headlight is so ill fitting that you cannot a hand between the light and the rest of the engine compartment components The accident happened in the fall As soon as summer came the entire bumper chrome strip crumbled We also noticed a strange noise and found out that the repair shop had not put clips on the flap extending from the bumper into the wheel well they glued it The winter weather followed by summer caused the glue to deteriorate letting the flap slap back and forth The paint used under the grill has orange peeled I have been calling and the body shop since June It is now October The only thing they have done is replaced the chrome strip available online for and change Repeated calls only result in the body shop pointing fingers at and pointing fingers at the body shop Who needs NOBODY  
 I recently tried switching from Progressive back to after a few years away from They lured me in with a really low quote days after switching I an email from that the rate is drastically increasing because of something found on the motor report I called immediately to find out what increased my rate The CS rep advised it was for an accident in I replied that my wife and I have not been in ANY accidents fault or otherwise while driving or involving our own since teenagers we are now The CS rep put me through to an underwriter for our State The underwriter treated me like I had memory problems instead of considering that their records were wrong   Let me refresh your memory    she I repeated that we have not been in any accidents I asked   Is there an accident showing up in our motor report    She replied   No    I asked   According to your records that we filed a claim with you did EVER send an adjuster to inspect a damaged for us to estimate a payout    She answered   No    Long story short because the call went on for almost an hour with her talking to me like I was a delusional idiot underwiter Erika admits that there is no evidence of an accident They claim my wife called for a claim in after   swerving to miss a dog and running off the road    I explained that this never happened that they must have this confused with someone else's claim She repeated that   We have your wife on record calling to report the accident and file a claim    No matter what I and without any proof other than their own internal claim that my wife called over an accident they would not work with me They tried to drastically raise my rate for a supposed accident that never took place and then pinned it on us like we are the ones who reported it and wanted the claim Thankfully Progressive reactivated my policy immediately when I called them back and confirmed they see no accident for my wife or I ever much less in Whatever the reps are smoking is some strong stuff because apparently magical fairies are telling them about accidents in which Toto is in the middle of the yellow brick road and we had to swerve to miss him I think they've been watching too many of their own commercials and think that fairy tales and talking lizards are real What REALLY happened is my wife called in after bottoming her out on the curb next to her mother's driveway when pulling out Not checking with me first or letting me look under the to see if there was any damage she called to INQUIRE that IF there was any damage to her HOW would she go about making a claim She did not make a claim she did not ask to make a claim She asked hypothetical questions and they turned around and filed it in their database as a   claim    They seemed to not be fazed by this truth or the fact that they never had an adjuster look at any damages and never paid out for a claim and had absolutely NO proof there was any accident Where they Toto in the middle of the road from only the fairies and talking lizard know Oh and according to them the was reported at being at Milton Ruben Auto shop waiting to be assessed for damaged Uh I worked at Milton Ruben at that time in which they see on my credit report they look at for quotes and it is not an auto shop an auto dealer superstore with no repair body shop and the be there anyway it was my wife's supposedly It makes me feel like they used our credit report and seeing Milton Ruben on it to try to add weight to their story and in the process fumbled by the fact wrong AGAIN be fooled by the cutsie commercials this company deserves a swift kick in the ass from lawsuits not your hard earned Consider if it were reversed if you made a claim and they investigated and had proof it was fraud nail your ass to the wall in court for fraud Yet apparently they think they need any proof whatsoever if they make a claim that something is true Total hypocrites  
 I was involved in an accident where I was hit in my new and the other driver took off refused to pay my medical injuries and the claims adjustors were plain rude acted as if I were bothering them would only respond to me via text or email Every time I finally through to their claims department after about prompts I would simply be sent to voice mail So basically only paying for the piece of paper they send you in the mail to show you have You buy to protect your investment not for the piece of paper they provide you with If the price seems to good usually for a reason Claims are absolutely horrible  
 I had a uninsured hit&run claim Dec and the claim is still ongoing The adjuster have my sent to a shop for diagnosis like he he would With the end result of my towed to a lot and every time I call them which I have literally around times since the incident if not the same responses   we responsible for diagnosis of your your responsibility   and btw I have full coverage   you only handle this with your auto adjuster sorry   And after I explain to them that I have and nothing's being done they say that response over and over Me and several American Sailors aboard USS Dwight D Eisenhower are having this problem it is such a stressful situation to deal with on top of the stresses I have already I have no idea of what to do they are trying to give me a partial claim but I refuse to accept it  
 On Sept while driving my my stepson was struck by a insured driver It was clearly the fault of the insured The police report stated that It was a noted that the insured driver was reported as an erratic driver half hour before the collision The insured driver stated that he was en route to the hospital due to an anxiety issue after being at a birthday party The insured driver was cited for driving on the wrong side of the road I carried no collision coverage on this with Nationwide As of September has refused to accept liability as my demolished had been in storage for over weeks should be thankful that their irresponsible driver kill my stepson in this accident Instead they are fighting me over year old worth maybe  
 My a hit and run at the rear of my leaving the window broken dented flat tire the unstable electrical control and suspension issue When I filed claim tried to classified my as total and only want to pay for of market value After more inspection they agree to repair but only part of it They were trying to save money During the repair they decided not to cover the window repair either and leaving myself to pay for it When the out of the shop I found out that the be locked The inexperienced worker messed up the locking system And when I confronted the agent he want to honor the issue saying it is not accident related is obviously scamming people's money is about protecting the unexpected Instead of honoring the make their clients a cash cow and double victim DO NO GO WITH THIS COMPANY THEIR PRACTICE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED  
 So far I was happy with until I had first claim with them because of accident Usually if you run into an accident then you feel fortunate if you have but in my case I felt why do I have or why do I have Here is my story Someone hit my on driver side front wheel I decided to use Xpress Repair as promised me for hassle free claim and adjuster take care of all repairs with lifetime guarantee on repairs if I use Xpress Repair program Xpress Repair shop body shop fixed the damage in the and replaced front left side strut and did the wheel alignment After this I noticed that is pulling to right side I again took it to body shop they sent me to alignment shop where they the alignment done Alignment shop me that you need to replace the other side strut to resolve the issue I spoke to adjuster regarding this he clearly me that we cover other strut as it is not involved in accident and I have to bear the cost of other strut I him that I think this could be because of strut It seems like some major damage in as I was having difficulty in driving it straight and I requested adjuster to it checked Adjuster me that body shop has already fixed it and alignment shop already checked it so your responsibility to take care of any other thing I tried to talk to adjuster multiple times and explained him that I never had this issue before accident so obviously it is because of accident but he did not listen to me and me that we cannot do anything Then I it checked at different place Technician at different shop found the exact issue and showed me that driver side wheel is set back by half an inch It could be because of some bent component with accident causing pulling to side Now I visually see the issue in my driver side wheel but adjuster and body shop never bothered to look into the issue Now when I explained them and showed the issue then they agreed to repair it again I again dropped my to body shop for further repairs After day body shop called me that we checked the and found many issues like alignment was off steering was not straight strut was not correctly tied and we are fixing it Now my question is to and their adjuster is that what kind of repair they done before They gave the to me without fixing it properly and on top of that they were claiming that everything has been fixed correctly and giving wrong suggestions to replace the struts After days body shop called me that we have fixed these things in your and now your is far better than before Again my question to is what is the meaning of is far better than before I again went to body shop took the test drive on my but still noticed the same issue I am really frustrated and disappointed with adjuster and their Xpress Repair body shop I have much time so that was the reason I decided to use Xpress Repair but I have already lost so much of my time and still my is not fixed completely  
 The worst experience with customer service Called days in a row to find out why they cancel my No really knows what is on No answer any questions no supervisor ever available and no calls you back STAY AWAY FROM NIGHTMARE CUSTOMER SERVICE  
 Beware they check your credit reports I had a score of above at the time I tried for this not great but not horrible However since when goes by your financial credit We had no accidents no tickets minor fender bender where no was hurt and before that nothing for ten years pay attention to the stupid commercials Go with Liberty Mutual They are a nice company The rates are not great either Two times I priced with them over the years and they were no great bargain at all  
My husband was hit by of their clients at an uncontrolled intersection The police report clearly shows their client was at fault and she was also cited for failure to yield causing the collision I NEVER do business with these crooks is the WORST company 
 is cheap They use junkyard parts and been without my for a month because they want to pay the auto body shop I be sure to tell everyone not to go through you I have friends in the process of dropping your sorry ** 
 A insured person rear ended my causing minimal damage to my where they did not minimal repair to my but my lb wife had back pain an hours after treatment from a Chiropractor the first provided no relief of symptoms so my wife found and was better Then based on the damage to my sent a letter to my wife and her she had NO injury and that they would not pay for any treatment First off how they assess pain like that My kids had sore backs that cleared up within a day but my wife's was acute caused by their insured is NOT an honorable Ins Co and I would urge anyone in a accident with a insured to seek Legal representation counsel so if an injury is involved and you recoup damages I would rate my overall exp with them as a but that is not an option  
 On September I was rammed in the back by a person who like I am is insured with I received a call from the claims adjuster stating that they would be handling my claim First she tried to tell me to take my to of their body shops at Sterling McCall Nissan I her that I need an estimate and I would be taking my to BMW for repairs Then she want to discuss my personal injury claim and that she would be setting aside for my hospital visits and any personal injuries because she wanted to resolve the personal injury side of the claim I her that she tell me where to go and that I hit was not feeling well because I am having headaches neck pains and stiffness lower back pains and pain all down my left side from the head to my knee She that she wanted to resolve the personal claim I her that I was to the chiropractor to my back and neck looked at and that she tell me about my injuries because she is not a physician She is a low level claim adjuster and that she would not be resolving my case and I have not be released from doctor's care I did not like her attitude she is pushing to resolve a claim before I thoroughly checked out and cleared by physicians These people want your monies but they do not want to deal with your claim and treat you fair once you are in an accident  
 I turn left with green arrow when I was % of my way and the witness started to go When I were in front of her she had green light and she slammed her brake she stopped but the girl next to her hit me because she see me The witness to me Your light turn red very fast And when I hit she was feet away from her white line And she tells that   that girl ran on red light I had my green light when she made her left turn It took me second to be in front of her and with that second she green light and go feet and HAD to slam on her brake to avoid me   My examiner her name is Paula to me   Yes ma'am   when I asked her times this question   You decided that at fault because when I were in front of the witness I were more than a half of my way to make my left turn the traffic light on my back turn red at fault    I received that   Yes ma'am   answer times I turned on my speaker and ask a guy to be my witness listen to my question and her answer But she stopped talking and that   I'm not talking in front of person who not involved in the accident   I   I need somebody to listen and hear your answer with me so I know that what I hear is what you say    But she want to talk anymore a person who hit and she she is customer service professional After that I ask to talk to her supervisor After my diagram explain step by step what was happening And he   Unfortunately their statement support each other   I ask   After you saw the diagram may I ask in your experience if from your white line to position in front of the witness how long and how far is it And if she had green light before I there how she be less than feet away from her white line    He answer He   but base on the witness statement she you ran red light     But she tell me the same thing    I   She me my light turn red very fast    But I asked manager   ask her    did she tell me   Your light turn red very fast    The manager called me this afternoon Sept and that he called but the witness kept saying that I ran on red He even mention about the question I want he ask her And he decision not change My problem is I have a Honda CRV my is total And I totally believe any service And excuse me if you are white blonde and pregnant stay away from me I believe that I buy And I pray everyday oh God help me release my anger Because all I have is this unfair liar and this kind of KIND P s Any attorney if you are interested in my case you are welcome to contact me  
 I was rear ended by driver who has a different company I contacted the from the scene of the accident My two children and I went to the hospital after the cops were done with their report I faxed a copy of the accident report to I felt uneasy by the way I was spoken to by the adjuster so I retained an attorney Now over months after the accident is refusing to pay my medical bills until after an examination under oath I submitted the accident report additional times because they they had not received it My children and I were taking a precaution by to the hospital Now the hospital is contacting me saying that because they have not had a response from the company they are holding me financially responsible I understand how I pay over a month for FULL COVERAGE I was stopped with my turn signal on and was rear ended I have been struggling with neck and back pain since the accident They are horrible to deal with My attorney me that since the beginning of January they want an examination under oath before they pay any claim The information they request for the EUO is ridiculous They want years of financial records statements of people who vouch for your whereabouts the day of the accident documents for any court involvement for the prior years etc As soon as my policy is due for renewal I am gone I pay more to have actual service  
 In August I was reviewing both my home and auto policies that I had with Nationwide Mutual Now I had been a loyal customer since but the rates I was being charged seemed to be twice the amount I was able to research online with the majority of carriers in Pennsylvania I decided to request a quote from since they are part of Berkshire Hathaway and they had a pretty good AM Best rating I began by navigating to their website and entering in the specifics for and my home When I the initial quote I was surprised to find the auto premium rate was almost less than my current Nationwide policy for the same coverage I contacted the local office to confirm that this quote was accurate no less than times before I committed to purchasing the coverage My last e mail from stated   We run our reports upfront that way there are no surprises When I issue a policy that rate is locked in I am not surprised he is telling you all this of course he does not want to lose the business Our rates are very good because we do not have agents on every corner like a lot of other companies Thank you Brian **    Well the story changed when I went to the office to remit the first month's premium Brian went to his PC and pulled up the quote he had sent me verifying the coverage He then stated he was to run a PA MVR report to be part of the living file on my It was then that he stated the policy premium amount would now be more per year because of a small scuff of bumper that I reported to Nationwide in the amount of back in November First he stated in his e mail to me that this report had been run   upfront so there are no surprises   Well Surprise He found one then proceeded to tell me about a similar incident with prospective customer involving an unknown police citation involving his son that bumped their premium cost up too Now Brian state they had these reports are prepared in advance so there were no surprises What a joke If they had actually calculated in the reported accident and provided me with an accurate cost I would not have wasted my time even pursuing the policy So much for expecting a fair deal I went with reputable carrier for the same quoted premium and coverage that had originally provided me And the new carrier even stated upfront that the MVR report was taken into consideration in providing me the costs for coverage better their act together

 I was involved in an accident with someone insured through assumed liability for everything I a rental I paid out of pocket I called them before I the to confirm they were to pay for it I had the for a week the time it took to fix my When I submitted the payment receipt to reimbursed I only paid for half of it Supposedly estimated the repair time was only to take days I dropped my on Tuesday the body shop worked on my estimate that day and sent it to me for approval which I did that day They started working on my on Wednesday The th day should have been Monday because they work on the weekend Somehow they have my ready until Tuesday afternoon only paid me from Tuesday to Friday I was never by even though we were in communication all the time that they were only to pay for what they estimated I called them and they they do anything about it  
 I've been with for years Always made my Payments and never been in a accident or ever received a speeding ticket June st I was rear ended I submitted all paperwork on a timely manner Since the accident been on disability and has treated me so badly They delay on payments and keep asking me for paperwork that I already submitted and later to be they located them which delays my payment to pay my rent and eat They deny medication bills because their physician believes I need it without even seeing me tells me they mailed out my check on tenth of the month but come to find out they mailed it out on the twelfth change my adjuster and even notify me of the change not even a letter I find out when I call to make a complaint about not receiving certain forms that I requested such as travel expenses forms that I was it was mailed out to me when in reality they and being that I could write my travel expenses on a plain piece of paper When I ask why I informed about being assigned a new adjuster they were like   We need to inform you    I am so disgusted with and their principles They care about their customers through a very difficult time with I control someone's driving I was hit in the back by driver is treating me like I caused the accident by their customer service They Suck Not honest and treat people unfairly leaving  
 I utilized the website to obtain a quote to see how much it might cost to add my son to my auto policy I added my son's information to the forms and then received a quote on page On that page there were two options button Finalize Quote and the other options Save Quote I clicked on the Save Quote button because I wanted to save the quote and compare it to other quotes I was then taken to a page that my son had been added to my policy and that my six month premium would increase by I saw no language anywhere that indicated that by clicking the Save Quote button that I was purchasing anything I called the customer support line and was that it is policy to add drivers in that way if any information is provided even if the consumer or customer does not elect to have that driver added I asked to have my son removed and to have my policy returned to its original state but I was that the only way I could accomplish this was to sign an exclusionary policy saying that my son in no way would be covered if he was to drive our I have difficulty believing that it is legal for a business entity to act this way or that it is a legal practice I am guessing that this is not an isolated incident I would definitely recommend not obtaining from and also avoiding other companies that engage in such practices

 I am offended by the new commercial put out about being there for military and veterans As a military member who was a member for over years they screwed me over When I was sent on a mandatory temporary duty assignment they required me to change my state for This resulted in Doubling my payments I am years old woman with a perfect driving record a military officer and I lived miles from work I was forced to pay a bunch of ending contract early payments when they forced me to leave the company In conclusion does not deserve to be able to lie to the public in commercials about doing anything for military members They do not

 Offer from is to less than minimum to replace my truck I have witnesses that verify that I spent over three months looking for that truck and paid the price to have an exceptionally beautiful truck Although it had the normal nicks and scratches I was constantly it was a nice truck Almost monthly someone would ask me if I would sell it I never considered saying yes because I know that age and mileage are not nearly as important as care and good maintenance on a truck that old As an example I replaced the transmission and engine with new Mr Goodwrench units All maintenance was with top quality parts The adjuster they used CCC to evaluate my truck CCC is a company that works for the industry They compared my truck with four junk value trucks None of the others had overdrive better gas mileage none had clear coat paint gives paint a deep shine and only had air conditioning a comfort must in Alabama There were a minimum of at least ten other enhancements present on my truck that were missing from the other so called comparable trucks has not dealt with me in good faith and has not accepted the fact their insured is responsible for destroying my investment  
 I have been automobile insured by I have a co owner of my whom is also on this full coverage policy Payments were made on time and no claims have ever been filed My license has been revoked for year sent a cancellation notice dated for next month as they accepted payment for the current month Upon receipt of this notice phoned requested to be removed from the policy so that the co owner would not have interruption in coverage I was by a rep that because the co owner and I reside in the same house they could not honor the policy I spoke to locally owned company who would establish a policy for my co owner but because we reside in the same resident would exclude me for legalities WONDER WHY WOULD NOT DO THAT OH WELL GUESS THEY HAVE SO MANY CUSTOMERS THEY NEED ME Cool DUCES  
 After reading the reviews here it appears is scamming and tricking customers They played similar games with me I have been a customer with them for close to years I was late on payment and they cancelled my policy I have been sick So I call to it restarted and pay them and they tell me I cannot have immediate coverage They refused to be flexible with me I be able to drive my until the next day meaning I would have to miss medical appointment I actually started crying Now I have to wait more months to back into this specialist and live in terrible pain First chance I have goodbye Disgusting how these companies abuse and exploit people because they have the upper hand laws They give me no deals for good driving etc All they had to do was be flexible But nope they sounded like a broken record   I am sorry our system allow that    
  was the first and only company I had ever insured with until recently My first policy with was for a month and it included everything The is financed Five years later and experiencing financial difficulties my policy lapsed and was eventually canceled When I had straightened everything out a year later and could finally afford to my back on the road wrote me a policy for a month and their explanation for it being so high was that I had left them and had I stayed with them all that time when it was impossible for me to do then I would have gotten a better price In other words was charging me a break up fee in the form of a policy nearly times more expensive It make sense to me and I them that there was no way I would ever agree to pay such an absurd amount of money The rep assured me that I find a better rate but I did at a month which is much more like it I knew that with my credit score being what it is there was no way that ever a policy for the old rate but was unacceptable was more reasonable never go back to ever again a spiteful sort of company too bad  
 I experienced the same thing when a customer backed into my vehicle's driver side door with the corner of her I did not have collision so sees they have leverage and wrote their liability letter stating each letter was at fault even after I submitted photographs blatantly falsifying their findings in their initial liability letter They even stated reason I was at fault is because I should have put my in reverse to avoid being hit by their driver this was stated by the claim examiner on a phone call with me two days ago I am submitting a complaint with the Department of Commerce in my state

  charged me for months for a and driver who was never on my policy I have only not and only drivers not Very upset about that be transferring to company very soon Their loss  
 I had for way too many years They kept raising the rates for no reason Worst of all was when a employee ran a red light in a owned The police cited her as at fault promised me lifetime warranty on the in repairs my needed But when some things were discovered as   not to code   they have refused to honor their warranty They do not answer calls and do not return messages To make it worse on a nationwide database they had listed that the accident was my fault When I found this out I started searching for a new company Found out that Consumer Reports gives a rating of D All the other companies I have called have prices are nearly half as expensive Wish I had done this years ago  
 My father passed away in March of this year & of the things he left me was his Dodge Charger that he absolutely loved When I took over the it needed a lot of help So after later the now looks like something my father would have been proud of So in early July I noticed chips in the windshield & I called about my glass coverage I am to schedule my repairs through Safelite & they pay for it I always see the Safelite commercials about them repairing these kinds of damage I scheduled Safelite through to come out to   repair   my windshield They arrive on time & begin work Next thing I know they are in the middle of pulling the extinguishing windshield out which only had small chips in it & are about to install a new windshield I had specifically to both & Safelite that it only needed to be repaired not replaced The new windshield is also subpar compared to the original as well Upon completion I noticed they left a lot of resin on both front fenders near the windshield & all along the new windshield as well as resin inside my interior I had a hard time cleaning up the resin on the exterior of the I STILL the resin out of my interior After finally cleaning the exterior of my I notice that they left scratches on both front fenders I had gotten this painted months prior & now ruined I then called to complain & all they would do is transfer me over to Safelite who then me I would have to take my down to the local shop for the shop manager to inspect I arrive at the local shop & wait about mins for the rude receptionist to off of the phone to help me Meanwhile the even ruder shop manager who was sitting directly behind her would not up to even look at me He was way too busy talking with of his friends to even do his job She finally finished her call & had the manager come out to inspect my He would not take any responsibility & proceeded to start an argument over how his guys could not have caused this damage & that he was only willing to buff the damage out The scratches go down to the metal You buff that out This now has to be repainted already fuming at this point I need this guy to me anymore angry than I already am I then call again to them on this because not paying for damage done to my when it was their recommendation to have Safelite replace my windshield when it only needed to be replaced I am that they contact Safelite set up compensation & call me back within hours I never hear back from I contact Safelite again & talk to Steve ** with their Executive Service Team who also tells me that he be in touch with me by the next morning I never hear back from him I contact Safelite yet again the next day this time through Facebook The person I am now put in touch with Sarah ** also with their Executive Service Team tells me that she was that I had refused their offer to have my repainted I NEVER that I had them that it needed to be repainted She then tells me that I would have to bring my to of their body shops to see if they feel the scratches be buffed out I refuse to bring my to any place connected to Safelite I worked in the auto body field before & I know what kind of damage is there I then threaten legal action & an estimate from a body shop that I trust funny the only way I was ever able to anything accomplished with these crooks was through Facebook & with my attorney contacting them I now have to be without a for days while the damage they caused is being repaired I am so livid at & Safelite This experience with both companies has opened up wounds while dealing with my father's death It has left me livid & hurt & this have been something that I should have had to deal with in this troubling time I be dropping my coverage as soon as the repairs to my are completed  
 I use as my company In April I contact them because I run over a piece of concrete on the road and I scratch the bottom of my They me I file a comprehensive claim and my policy not be affected with an increase or something like that The damage on the cost me about dollars my deductible was So they me that being a comprehensive claim it not affect the price of my policy So I filed the claim Yesterday when my renewal time shows up the price of my policy jump from to double of what I was paying So be careful with They lie to me and now they are charging double of the price  
I had a accident last year July ' It was not my fault still waiting for medical help I have herniated discs due to the wait I have not been able to work full time thanks to that and I not walk For saving money like this now Thanks to 
 I had a cancellation which I paid to reinstate I informed them I had sr they they did and then I noticed the auto draft did not taken out so I called and because they did not add my sr back to my policy I have to pay my whole premium or pay to my revoked license back I called and I wanted to report the lady whom I was ok and she contacted the DMV that my was paid They refused to let me report it Very bad customer service and they misinformed me  
 I have a Chevy Cobalt As sure you know there is a recall on this particular regarding the ignition switch   The are being recalled because the faulty ignition switches could inadvertently turn off the engine and most of the electrical components on the as well as disabling the airbags The problem occurs if the ignition key is jarred or a heavy key ring causes the ignition switch to be moved out of the   run   position The problem also may occur if the goes off road or experiences some other jarring event according to GM    Several weeks ago I returned to work from leaving to eat lunch When I pulled into my regular parking spot I was unable to turn the key from the on position thus leaving me no other option but to leave my running I immediately called roadside assistance The person that answered the phone was very nice and seemed as though he wanted to help me however once I explained the issue after putting me on hold to do some investigation he me that my problem was not considered an emergency He further explained that they could send a tow truck out but I would have to pay for those services At that point I began very frustrated I did yell at the man that was helping me and I am very sorry for that as I am sure it his fault however he did not even attempt to ask the tow company or their lock smith if either could assist me until I did so When he returned on the phone he me the same thing that he had previously stated Based on the recall on my I had three options in my situation • I let my run until there was no more gas in the • I stall it out but am still forced to have the turned on causing the battery to die • I drive it somewhere to have someone fix it for me taking the chance that the engine could stop causing me to crash EITHER of these options would have been considered an emergency by this company and worthy of roadside assistance however you were not willing to help prevent any of these from occurring which is EXTREMELY appalling to me In addition I am able to receive coverage from Nationwide for less for better coverage and so far better customer service  
 Our son had a brand new subaru less than miles on it Was t boned by a drunk driver in Salt Lake City of all places Everyone walked away from the accident the drunk driver had Spoke to the rep from who they assumed all responsibility Then for the next minutes proceeded to tell me what they WOULD NOT DO No new replacement limited replacement value little offered except to   fix   a brand new which of course diminished the value greatly Wow and the rep was super nasty when asked about coverage They covered a drunk driver and refused to do   the right   thing Horrible that they would even offer anything other than complete replacement Hindsight we should have sued them in court you imagine a drunk driver case in Salt Lake City  
 I cancelled my auto policy with and was I would receive a refund They informed me that the refund would go back onto the bank card I used to make payments I wrote them and explained that my father and I had a joint account He was ill and I had to be authorized to sign checks and he passed away The military and social security sends their payments into that account and our bills come out but when he passed away the military and social security went back and retrieved their funds and mine and the account was overdrawn at the time and until everything sorted out I needed to send my refund in a check to my address on file I have the emails where they they reviewed my situation and they would send my refund to my house in check form and send it to the bank Well it happen I called to see where my refund was and the moron I spoke to it was sent to the bank I proceeded to tell this idiot that been through this and I have emails stating that it be sent to the bank and I would it sent in check form to my house I even sent this person the emails She reviewed those emails and had me on hold for quite a while She came back on the line saying the lady I spoke with that me a check was wrong and know what she was doing I she is a customer service supervisor She me basically that I misunderstood the emails and nothing they do for me This company is full of lying morons and I let them Insure my of Pepsi They double talk basically tell you that stupid and no knows what's on She me that there was no reference to my policy in those emails I yes there is it not only has my policy number but a case number as well I was put on hold again so they could come up with more bullshit lies And she came back saying that she could see how I would take the email like I did but I understanding the whole thing Like stupid If anyone wants to see these emails I have be more than happy to send them to anyone They are pretty much self explanatory But to her a big dummy that read insulting my intelligence done with this company and advise anyone to stay away from  
 My husband has been Customer for years with zero claims He has his covered under and mine is covered under Safeco I am not covered on his policy and vice versa but our names are on the policy for legal reasons and we are excluded from driving each other's not the issue He hit my in the street and refuses to pay not his mine But they say his too and refuse to pay Leaving me to an attorney or have my pay which has a dd which I have to pay lost his business never mine They the policy cover hitting your own property Well what the heck does it cover Seems to me you'd take care of your own with more grace than you would someone who been dumping cash into your cow for years  
I signed up with in May and made every monthly payment on time Sometimes I added and deleted drivers and I was always sure to pay the difference However repeatedly changed my payment due dates to where the last to months I was making payments PER MONTH When I would speak to about the enormous amounts they were charging me every agent would have a DIFFERENT REASON keeps very unorganized financial records They change due dates on you so that they are money for your far less than days apart I was that my rates would drop when certain changes were made However my rates always went up and agent even me the reason was because I pay the month before So I had to go through the work to fax in my bank statement to prove consistent payments So the agent gave me a different reason and a third agent gave me even reason So sure the commercials are cute but RIPS PEOPLE OFF AND THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS They are happy to you signed up and take your money but they do not have an honest system as they are constantly overcharging customers like some sleazy cable companies I never work with again If you keep your eye on them they be taking much more money than they explain logically 
  customer backed into my driver door after I had already backed out The driver apologized saying she did not see me The claims adjuster Jennifer ** of the Virginia Beach office stated that it appeared their driver was at fault because there is no possible way I back out sideways However the next day the determination was that we were both at fault and therefore would not pay Besides the failure of to take responsibility I am not the Man you know made of money  
 We had our policy to be billed electronically each month and we would receive a text message notifying us of the transaction We did receive the text saying they would be taking payment as usual Then we received a letter while on vacation overseas saying our policy had been cancelled and that we needed to pay a due amount When we called to ask why the policy had been cancelled the rep it was because the card that they charged the bill to had been declined Well we gave her the same card number that they had been using to charge us each month and it went thru fine They bother to call us when they supposedly had issues charging the card the letter that stated the policy was cancelled and that there was a due amount In order for us to coverage once again with no changes to previous coverage they wanted to charge us an additional dollars I think this was a straight scam in order to more money I am outraged that they even concede that it was their fault for not reaching out via phone email prior to cancelling the policy We have decided to go with USAA since we have our other policies with them Should have done this from the go  
 We live in upstate NY In January of my wife and three kids ranging in age from were on their way to school in the morning when they were struck by a insured by The driver of the who was driving on a suspended license which means his right to drive in NY was suspended crossed a double yellow line and struck our Honda Odyssey van head on on the driver side My wife was driving obviously with our year old son in the passenger side front and the two other children in the second row seats All were wearing their seat belts and thankfully my wife responded very quickly swerving the van away and onto the curb to the right of the roadway greatly diminishing the impact Both front airbags deployed causing minor injury to my wife's hand wrist and fingers We praise God that no was seriously injured Not surprisingly the driver of the other was only concerned with making statements to my wife about how much trouble he was in and had no interest or concern with whether the people he hit were injured Our van which valued out at around was nearly totaled but was around from reaching that threshold Our Travelers was outstanding They were very helpful and polite and had everything rolling on making sure we were taken care of and proper procedures were followed within hours from the initial accident Now for As I the other was insured by and because of the fact that there was no disputing the other person in the insured by was at fault he was all the way to the curb on the opposite side of the road when he struck our van and was issued tickets by the police   accepted liability for the accident   They snapped into action and after contacting me and looking at the their adjuster wanted to know where and when we could meet up so he could immediately issue me a check for approximately dollars to repair the Thankfully I did not accept his check because I later found out two things first if I had accepted the check I was acknowledging that the claim was settled Second the repairs ended up being thousands of dollars more than the check wanted me to take As a result of communicating with my company Travelers they recommended that I file the claim through them so that the repairs could be completed and they would go after for the money If I chose to settle it on my own I would need to go after for the money and ultimately hire my own lawyer since they were only willing to offer the So we went through our and took the to the repair shop The was their for approximately weeks while being repaired during which we had a rental And when I say I mean Toyota Yaris size Two adults and three teens nearly all teens and refused to pay for anything larger than a compact At least is saved on gas I guess Fast forward to today Our van is repaired but is still not right We have had the into various shops at least times that I recall for problems Two of the tires not hold air Approximately every week to days were have to fill them No figure out why but they were the two front tires in the accident I seem to them replaced even though we have been in repeatedly In addition the turn signals no longer reset on their own I know it minor but not how they were before the accident Worst of all the VSA system on the van engages at random times On at least occasions the VSA stability assist has engaged at times when it should not This causes the anti lock brakes to activate and slow the sometimes the brakes engage the brake pedal pulsates We have had the van into the shop at least times for this and we have contacted Honda directly but no figure out why it keeps doing this Recently it engaged why my wife was traveling MPH on a straight dry road This is not good And guess what has NOT PAID A SINGLE DIME OF THE CLAIM AS OF TODAY They have refused to pay Travelers for the repairs and Travelers has had to file and arbitration claim against them in spite of the fact that on day they claimed that they   accepted full responsibility   and there has never been any dispute as to who was at fault THEY HAVE NOT PAID A SINGLE DIME As a result I my policy renewal from Travelers recently only to find that it had increased by over because of a surcharge for an unpaid claim Awesome Thanks As a result of the mechanical problems I looked into trading the in Well interestingly now that this near total accident is on the carfax report dealers want to sell the on their lot and only give me wholesale value for trade because they would take it straight to auction Honda dealer me in a written letter that as a   reputable dealer we would never sell this on our lot   Great So somewhere along the line in talking with someone about this informed about a diminished value claim that I could file a claim to recoup the lost value of my because of the accident So I called the adjuster who tried to give me the check He tells me   oh no you do that we accept those claims    After arguing with him for a few minutes he that he   believe   accepted them and would have to call his supervisor He calls her then calls me back and says   yep I was right we    So I obtained his supervisor's name and called her Tracy ** She proceeds to tell me when I mentioned a lawyer that she never the adjuster this and that if I wanted to file a claim I had to contact a different department So I called the other department which I had to call department After a huge run around from everyone I talked to I finally talked with someone who I could file the claim but they needed documentation that the had lost value When I pressed what that might be he it could be paperwork from the dealer I was given a fax number to fax the documentation to So I the documentation from the dealer and faxed it in I quickly heard back from indicating that my diminished value claim was rejected because I still owned the and would need to sell it or trade it in and then show proof that I had lost money from the deal Wow changing the rules after I followed the other ones they established Besides that sounds like a great idea Lose money on a sale or trade in then try to the lost money from a company that has still not paid a single dime of the repair costs from the initial accident Thanks again for the help There is a lot more detail to offer including how rude the employees have been in treating me like this was an inconvenience for them but this review is long enough already In summary customer service has been horrible they have not paid a single dime of the claim they have tried to me to accept less to release them from paying full repairs my van still right worth thousands of dollars less my assessed a fee because of refusal to pay for the damages and the claim is now in arbitration is horrible My advise to anyone looking into them for is to run away If you are in an accident and they are the insurer of the at fault assistance from your company or be prepared to a lawyer Spread the word to anyone you know Hopefully someone avoid the mess we have gone through and believe me I realize it could be and is for many worse than our situation if they are warned Spread the word loss of profits is about the only thing that teaches big companies now day  
 I complete an online quote and began the process of purchasing a policy I entered all the payment information I also entered an at fault accident I had a year ago during the application process including my driver's license information and the details of the accident They gave me a quote of per month At the purchase screen the rate was   adjusted   to a whopping per month I called a customer service representative and she reviewed my information She the accident was initially calculated at years ago and the adjustment was because the accident was only year ago This is a classic   bait and switch   tactic to try and upsell a much higher rate policy  
 I was involved in an accident on the Southern State Parkway in New York in which struck mine The woman who hit my changed her story countless times so her All State refused to immediately take responsibility I contacted seeking help and was to take responsibility as it was easier and could my fixed quickly When I refused as I was not to take responsibility for an accident that was not my fault and would subsequently raise my rates I was to fight it out with All State My was no longer drivable therefore I was forced to rent a in order to travel to and from work while I was being strung along by both companies All State eventually denied my claim although the police report states that their driver hit me and was to go fight it out with to fix my sent an adjuster to look at my and and assess its damage It has now been two weeks since the damage and I am still driving a rental I was informed by that they not pay for the first week of the rental as the claim was still being processed by All State So now I am out a lot of money my is not fixed and I still have no end in site This is an absolute nightmare with nothing but incompetence and rude people and have been unable to any help from anyone  
 I have been with for the last two years and never had a speeding ticket accident or any type of claim Each time I went to renew there was a fee increase and when questioning why based on my record I was always informed it was state wide increase I recently moved miles away from my old address and my policy went from to When I informed them I would not pay this amount and questioned why they would charge a customer with great record and pays on time this amount it was the standard it is like this everywhere and they are the best fees around I immediately off the phone and called other companies and found a cheaper rate than my original I called them back to compare fees and they replied the only way they could work to lower the rate is if I also added my home policy to my current policy WHAT A JOKE They are not about customer service but about your money being rude and unhelpful in every sense  
 On June I spoke with a agent regarding impending charges of for the month of June I did not owe any back payments but the representative would not supply me with any reason for the charges I explained that I did not have or any other payment due to limited funds to pay my rent I was that there were no charges being processed or sent to my financial institution I was also that I was taken off auto pay meaning no charges would be taken out using e checking debit card I was that after non payment I would receive a notice giving me a pay by date before the was dropped I explained that I would be able to pay before the policy was dropped Well the charges were processed later that day by auto pay and my rent check bounced After a lengthy dispute with my financial institution mastercard I was that unless I had hard copy documentation of my June conversation with the dispute would be dropped I explained that did not provide a copy of my phone conversation and did not understand how that could even be a possibility I also explained that had never sent a signed contract document or cards for my policy I then contacted the BBB in Washington D C claimed they sent a contract but as of today I have never received anything in writing from them I have no trust for a company that operates in this manner I am sorry I ever had a relationship with them I have been treated unfairly but feel that since has more options for loopholes they do whatever they please I am cancelling my checking account because of this  
  strongly tried to convince us into using a    certified   repair shop We declined Because of that we had to wait approx days to an appointment The estimate was LESS THAN HALF of the estimate we had done while we were waiting the six days After asking MAKING SURE WITH EMPLOYEES and with the Repair Supervisor that we would not owe anything and that would repair our % the Repair Place Helfman Dodge in Houston still tried to collect from us with the old   labor charge scam   a sad world stands out among lowdown dirty rip offs buy their auto  
  years driving experience no accidents or moving violations accident on icy private road no other rate increase of per mo for myself and wife's since I may drive it You've to be kidding me Be careful who you insure with  
 On July I bought a p u and tried to it on my policy After being on hold for mins a gal came on and asked to help me I gave her policy # and she she had my account I ask if she could change my email of record She yes but then she she lic to do business in TX she would have to transfer me I need to this done so I the truck inspected So I stayed on hold for mins at that time They hung without me ever talking to an agent I know I was stupid for holding so long but after the first I wanted to know how long it would take Now I know never  
  added our son onto our policy without our permission or requesting them to do so because a consumer reporting agency he lives here He live here nor does he drive our They added onto our monthly automatic payment YES THEY STOLE from us If you are with switch now You've been warned They are thieves They us all firms do this We called State Farm and they constitutes theft and fraud and no other companies do this Of course we never our back but we switched to State Farm and saved per month  
 I had damage to my last year in June it took them over a month and a half to the payment to the body shop Ok let that slide but my daughter wrecked her ironically the exact same time as last year Anyway the accident was on I called them on it is now and the still fixed In both instances they keep claiming they are not receiving the photos from the body shop they have given them at least different emails and as of today I still heard anything from them and neither has the body shop I live in Podunk mo and they do not even have claim adjusters come look at the On top of that my payment went from a month to  
 I was a victim of theft when my battery went dead on me on the wrong side of town I was unable to roll up my power windows and was forced to leave my overnight in the ghetto I was robbed of my radio and my sound system which my comprehensive coverage from covers that I filed a claim and was set up for inspection and they accused me of Fraud Next I was harassed by some alleged special investigations man over the phone Then he pops up over my house threatening me to sign a claim withdrawal or I be thrown in jail I advised him that I signing anything and every time I call to status I am informed I receive something by mail It has been a month and I have not received anything nor compensation for the replacement of my personal items  
 I filed a claim with and with the initial intake the customer service claims person was very rude Then the adjuster called me he questioned me over and over again about hail damage on my and I advised him I was traveling over the holiday weekend It is a simple hail claim they had a storm in that particular city He advised me he search the weather and could not find a storm in that particular city that I was in So I promptly gathered information from the weather station and sent it to him His next reply was the city I was in had hail storms but it was further north I advised him that first he that the city I was in did not have hail storm now you are saying it did but was further north I then I felt that was trying to out of this claim and I would have it further investigated by my state commissioner The day after I him I would have the investigated by state commissioner He sent my claim to an investigator within The biggest part is he has not even sent an inspector to come out to look at my as of yet but he hurriedly sent my claim to an investigator There has been no payment nor an inspector who has even looked at my So what's to further investigate I investigators no longer offering answers to their questions They would have to ask my state commissioner who be investigating the processing of my claim Its unbelievable that you try to make a claim with and they not honor it and then have the nerve to assign an investigator to a simple HAIL CLAIM I have been an off and on customer for years and never filed any claims but be cancelling and never returning If you have to do this much fighting its not an company I want to give my money to  
 Government Employee Company hereafter 's insured customer at fault crashed into my named as the payee for repairs stated that they would bring my back to pre crashed status but would not honor objective rd party expert inspection of the should the rd party assessment deviate from their own assessments The behavior of both office and location staff was to minimize losses with no interest in myself while consistently reiterating that they have my interests at heart But would not honor an objective parties assessment The At Fault party is using as the payee and is vehemently acting to protect own interests They rush to repair so I have no opportunity to receive a structural assessment of the damage by a qualified party while the underlying structure is exposed The representative also refused to perform a alignment test to assess whether the damage Front right hand quadrant had disrupted the frame geometry of steering alignment I asked if the representative had formal education knowledge of structural integrity and he responded he did not Require that the has a professional rd party inspection performed and tested by a non employee for structural integrity  
 They signed me up me I would be contacted by identity protection company They take your premiums and never give anything that resembles a policy What you really need is protection from sales people big scam Bottom line is you are buying nothing be a victim  
I was Broadsided & injured by someone driving a huge SUV They ran a light & slammed into the side of my injuring me & my sister Both that driver and myself were covered by G decided to cover them been paying G for over yrs 
 I have been dealing with for the last month and a half from trying to an adjuster to finally come out to arguing with them about the new labor rates This labor rate issue has really me mad The SE Texas area rates are changing but refuses to recognize this I called over of the most prominent body shops in the Golden Triangle area and out of those only were still at the rate of which be changing within the year's end I worked my way up through the corporate chain I have been hollered at called a liar that there is a mafia forming between the body shops flooding the area with a rate hike that I was a country bumpkin that should keep my mouth closed and to   shut up **   when I started telling an upper person the Texas law about freedom of choice in body shops and it being against the law for an company to coerce the policy owner to choose their   preferred   shop because they want to pay the rate increases They even stooped as low as threaten to sue the body shop my is at because I refused to let come remove my from there and take it somewhere else I was that in the next hours they be sending the area supervisor Rick ** to the body shop to deal with this discord When asked if they were to let me hang on this price difference and not take care of their client they point blank that they are not to pay at any rate above the for anyone and that care what is or done They are standing their ground and not be persuaded to change for any reason I have spoken to Evan ** Beaumont his supervisor Rick ** Houston and Mark ** Dallas Next in line is the asst V P for Texas Daniel ** Dallas Hopefully I some help from him so that others like myself do not have to deal with this hassle again I have also filed different complaints with the Texas Dept of but seeing that they are days backlogged it be some time before they help in any way  
 I had an auto accident and was covered under I found a body shop and took the to the shop It took the adjuster weeks to to the shop while I was out of a no rental coverage The Body shop quoted the price for repairs which seemed fair for the damage Then the adjuster went out to the body shop and decided that the claim was too high He   worked   with the body shop to adjust the claim to what was payable by After the Adjuster spoke to the body shop the quote was cut down by half what the body shop was quoting initially The only thing that the agent was that everything was settled I then called the body shop to find that the original quote was cut in half I inquired how this was possible Apparently has a right to put in USED PARTS in the This was the first time I heard of an company only willing to pay for used parts They put in a used strut in my which still run correctly I was disgusted with this They show a hundred thousand commercials a day and waste money but when it comes to their clients they are plain terrible Made a huge mistake them as an company never make that mistake again I wish this company on my worst enemies I think underhanded business such as this happen but apparently it does  
  has the worst customer service They your information wrong at the time of signing up and then cancel you without notice The salesmen are A H You wait forever on the phone for someone then they treat you like crap They never make good on their mistake Their automated system does not support address with and then they blame you Their policy states what they cancel you for but they do anyway This company is bad Do not use them even if they are cheap  
 My husband was hit by an ex convict head on No injuries thank God but this criminal was driving on a revoked license in an Enterprise rental that he borrowed from his girlfriend His girlfriend also has Even though she he were at fault immediately due to the tickets and witnesses failed to process their claim and have our repaired been more than day legal period for any statements etc to be made you believe this cut and dry collision happened May th and it is now June th and we are still owed our deductible because my husband and I had to go ahead and pay out of pocket and start the claim ourselves on our own because   couldn't reach the driver   and   has to wait to interview the driver   and etc etc We heard this week after week Now is arguing with Enterprise to see who pays my husband and I back our deductible Meanwhile money is sitting in an account accruing interest while we eat Ramen noodles and cancel all summer plans because we're out of money your negotiation skills are poor Your adjustors are slow to respond You make money and your customer loses it We're dropping you And we might hire a lawyer and sue in addition to the driver for loss of use payback for the week rental we could only afford bus fair and emotional stress  
  is no longer willing to insure me because my husband has a suspended license Because married I am not allowed to have a policy of my own without him being on it I have zero points on my license no accidents and no tickets yet they give me my own policy because I am married to someone currently without a license That is the dumbest policy I have ever heard and I gladly take my business elsewhere  
 About a few weeks ago my sister was in a hit and run accident wrecking her She called her company to report the incident and they have given her the run around ever since So apparently with you have to call them and verbally request to renew coverage They informed my sister that although she has been a loyal customer of years and never had to call to renew because she has automatic draft That the day of her accident which happened at pm and the draft of her account at pm between that time she was not covered because she had not called to say she was staying with their company How convenient  
 I did a routine review of my auto rates recently and discovered that I could save over per year by switching to Safeco I immediately signed up and contacted to cancel my existing policy Much to my surprise I was given misinformation by the first clerk that I spoke to I was to mail in my request to cancel which I need to do as stated by a second clerk a week later The second clerk me that all I needed to do was submit my request on their site and all would be ok She also gave me my refund amount of When the actual refund came it amounted to only I immediately call to find out why the refund was so low I was informed that the State of North Carolina allows them to take what's call a Short Rate Premium for early cancellations as well as a percentage of your actual refund Here are my numbers Total Amount of six month premium = x % Short Rate Premium = Subtract that amount from the amount actually paid = the actual amount of gross refund But wait here's the kicker takes That's over % from my refund as an additional penalty which amounts to My net refund according to is only What a rip off and I plan to tell everyone I know

 I was in accidents With and Farmers rear ends the Farmers Farmers rear ends me when I hit no one My was a total loss estimated by their adjuster Total loss value was only is written citations and they admit % guilt I ask for a rental and was denied I had to to work This accident happened in Oct by the way and today is June th of So in October I rented a for a month out of my pocket I kept calling Justin ** with claims and he kept telling me he was waiting for Farmers I need money to put down on a They help me with anything I finally gave the rental up and acquired for a rental out of my own pocket Their client had a property damage cap of June after an adjuster my was and I spent for a rental they offered me a settlement offer of I accepted on June nd and I sent release form and I still received my check Justin ** from has given me the run around very stern and care unlike most agencies He basically has lied to me about everything So it has taken months to finalized and I still have a  
 I called for a quote only A few days later they opened an account without permission This is ridiculous The bill came to without an account being opened After I the mess sorted they still I owed money for an account I never opened or approved  
 Do NOT use as your Auto carrier EVER Let me explain yesterday Friday I returned from work to find that three of four tires on my had been slashed Bad enough but I figured I had the whole weekend to deal with the issue and since the had comprehensive coverage there would be no out of pocket expenses outside of my deductible WRONG Started off well enough I talked to a person gave the details was that I was covered even the tow to the tire dealership It was exactly the type of service I expected The problems started on Saturday I started calling around for tires and all dealerships were saying that I would have to pay for the tires out of pocket and put in a claim for reimbursement Nothing about that had been mentioned to me Friday night so I called the claims department early Saturday There 'Gary' me that I covered unless there was actual damage This was the first time I had ever put in a claim since starting with five years ago Was this the   say no 'till they give up   type of thing heard about Asked to speak to his supervisor since wanted accurate info on this He came back after being put on hold Learned that he was new and looking at the Comprehensive policy OK no harm but the alarm bells were still ringing in my head Now the real issue came out I my tires until a claim adjuster came out and inspected the tires OK when would he show up Sorry there are no adjusters on weekends You have to wait until Monday This is unacceptable as I need that actually needed it that day No mention of this process had been made to me on Friday when I could have actually had it done Asked to speak to his supervisor anyway as I needed to this resolved now 'Sarah' employee #** on the line Hoping for something better I once again explained the situation gave my claim number from Friday and was once again that nothing would be done until Monday WHAT Evidently there are absolutely no adjusters working weekends in the entire San Diego Metro area the rd largest city in the state I was that I could pay for them myself and reimbursed Well first off I have started working after being unemployed for over a year and I need that to to work I personal time off for days Second as you guess I have the money laying around for new tires why I have 'Sarah' was singularly unhelpful but was repeatedly   sorry   I asked if the tow at least was covered 'Sarah' immediately the towing department on the line then dropped off herself ask if I had any further questions I did nothing dial and dump At least the tow is covered Anyway unless you want zero support when you need it most look somewhere else for coverage Yes there cheap but you see why Personally to look for a company there when I need them not when they feel like it It may cost a little more but it be worth it  
 I was in an accident involving party who ran a red light and caused a T bone like collision between the two of us There was a police report and a third party witness both stating that the other driver ran the red light as I was making a left hand turn through a green light The other driver however contested the incident saying that they did not run a red light and were not at fault despite all the evidence called after an 'investigation' saying that I was not at fault and they were waiting to see how responsibility for my damages would play out because an unauthorized driver of a rental was the at fault driver The next day I received a call saying they changed their mind and I am now being held % at fault due to the point of collision They that because my hit theirs where it did the other was   established in the intersection   even though they had a red light and I should have been aware enough to avoid the accident I contested to upper level management that I in fact was aware that they were running the red light and slammed on my breaks in order to avoid the collision but my failed attempt resulted in a t bone Had I not taken this defensive driving technique I would have been hit on my driver's side door and things would have been much more serious After contesting my defense and refusing to accept % responsibility they reversed their decision again making me completely not at fault As I was waiting to hear from the other policy I gave them a call only to find out that the party who ran the red light is also listed % not at fault Keep in mind this party is also insured I was that they only have evidence that my light was green but not that their light was red I asked to have someone from come time the traffic light as it is % impossible that they entered the intersection at a yellow light and mine turned green before they exited the intersection says they cannot do this Because of this   no is at fault   approach my policy is the only thing that cover my damages I am paying my deductible in order to my repaired in a timely manner but am completely dissatisfied with the fact that I am now out of pocket for an accident that I was completely not at fault for Does anyone have any advice

 My was vandalized by known individuals Because it was not the first time it had happened and the first time the had been towed from the location that it had been damaged they would not pay for damages to the because they were there prior to the incident report They spoke to the towing company that towed the and were what parts of the were damaged when they towed it Because part of this was reported as a discrepancy in the beginning by the insured who was not present at the time of the tow they refused to pay for all of the other damages which included keying of the entire slashed all tires disabling of ignition dent to rear panel driver side door would not close properly rear automatic sliding door would not close properly and potential other damage that was not written by the adjustor because he did not look at the engine transmission parts to determine if they were operational this why you pay your premiums to an company so they provide in the event you have a loss I would not recommend to anyone I intend to switch to State Farm immediately

 failed to pay claims They also incorrectly quoted me and did not give me comprehensive like I had for the last years with State Farm When I filed a claim they sent an investigator to meet us at Starbucks which is so unprofessional My husband refused to be interviewed as he has aphasia They then threatened me saying him to come back here and talk in a bullying manner I'I we intimidate witnesses Nor we require people with aphasia to speak when they can't They are bullies crooks and liars and thieves use them They never pay any claims

 First off the adjuster is uncaring argumentative and refuses to listen His arrogance is somewhat annoying especially after an accident I have a Nissan Rogue Everything from the front of the to the back doors was demolished by a herd of deer I believe I hit all four deer and I in fact killed two in the strike His initial estimate was about grand lower than our private adjuster He was rude about it when questioned came and picked up the without asking me where to repair it I assumed they were towing it to an adjuster Next thing I know their certified repair shop is asking to begin repairs I unless he is Nissan certified I want the repaired It was an instant battle with the adjuster He asked me   why would you tow it here if you want it repaired here    I nobody asked me where I wanted it repaired He then accused me of wanting it totaled which I do given that percent of the needs painted and replaced Every part is aftermarket and if you google the brand they have horrible ratings on the parts I am shocked at behavior After trying to reach a manager I have since given up Every time you try you directed back to this unprofessional adjuster All in all if the adjuster would have given me the facts about the KY laws to begin with this would have been easier Nonetheless CUTS CORNERS IN YOUR REPAIRS TO KEEP FROM TOTALING YOUR

 I was rear ended by policy holder the claim examiner that I was faking a back injury but different doctors examined me and the same thing She that the injury that I have could never had happened even though I was rear ended The examiner denied my claim and put false information in the denial letter things that did not happen or was In the beginning she started calling me to see if I was okay and then she turned into Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide when I sent her a proposal that she was a demand  
 I insured two with was involved in an accident and was readily willing and able to give the driver of the other the kitchen sink They did no investigation and were not planning to do an investigation The agent assigned to the case was rude arrogant and surly When I tried to report her defended her and did absolutely nothing to message me their customer A few months later they apparently investigated me and determined that my driving activities appeared to occur downstate and my policy was opened in upstate New York They were to raise my rates from a month to a month and were planning to deduct this from my checking account I stopped that and found other I also received a call from my friend a customer who was in the midst of a hit and run scam was placing the onus upon her and refusing to investigate the fraud Apparently they are poised to issue the scammer a check This company is not on your side The result be increased rates for my friend  
 My first no fault accident was on I was rear ended and informed that the did not feel right and it had mechanical problems The adjuster refused to look at it and I was contacted by his supervisor that then explained that there is   no possibility of a problem when rear ended   I did not agree On my lost control for no reason and went into a spin I hit a guard rail head on and then the back hit the guard rail I ended up blocking the parkway The did not hit nor was I hit It lost control promised me ded I was supposed to pick up the check on but I did not have the title I the title called them and was that the supervisor would like the amount reduced by This Supervisor was the same supervisor that denied me to check the thoroughly I borrowed the money and was guaranteed to this check for is refusing to honor the agreement and has since reappraised the and used a fraudulent submission date as the estimate when I have the actual numbers that they gave for that time period I have called numerous times with no assistance I need help In addition I have no idea where the is I was was to pick it up and take it on however they have no title or release

 I spoke with a agent about a policy No accidents no claims put into since I know when Years Did have some comprehensive claims a deer hit me and a tree fell on my really I was interested in Comprehensive only no collision He went over all the coverages and limits with me Agent gave me a quote asked if that included rental coverage for a comprehensive claim   Oh I think you needed that since you collision    Alright Added the rental coverage in to the quote Agent asked for debit card number for payment gave him my debit card number Next thing I know he says he ran my motor report Found a cell phone ticket from a few months ago Gave me a new quote of more for the year A cell phone ticket increased my rates a year WOW a lot The cell phone ticket was I asked the agent why he hadn't checked my MVR before giving me the initial quote He has to pay the DMV for the MVR so they run it until you commit to a policy give them payment method So lesson here is give your money or credit card number until they've given you a FINAL QUOTE Also if you a cell phone ticket expect a rate increase and a BIG from buy  
I ask an agent to speak to her supervisor When the supervisor called me back she immediately went into defense mode I ask her several times I speak CA check the phone records and see how irate she was as if it was her that was hit All I want is my fixed

 My son was involved in a collision with a insured customer from Nicaragua My son was straight through a yellow light and the other guy turned in front of him My son had the right of way light yellow both ways w no turn arrow The other guy tried to say his light was yellow and my son's was red Not possible Police report indicated the other guy The other guy even hired an attorney to try and push this did their own investigation paid for our totaled Case closed This was years ago About months ago we a letter from vs the other guy yes their client that turned in front of my son asked my son to please call as they were being sued and wanted to ask my son some questions We knew this other guy was trying to money out of That letter went in the trash today we receive a letter from and now it is and the other guy vs my son I believe they go to these lengths of fraud The claim my son must have gone over the yellow line and hit the guy He I have pictures and eyewitnesses in my file as I showed up minutes after it happened This crook stop at nothing and now is aligning themselves with this extortionist to try and their money back Unbelievable This is dishonest and fraud and they are in for a rude awakening  
 I spent several hours working through establishing three policies with and received what I thought were confirmed quotes When calling to finalize the auto policy the agent indicated that he had found a claim from years ago I explained that it involved a payout from a previous company because of a theft We had a stolen in Los Angeles Suddenly the rate went up dollars per month They clearly should have reviewed this information when providing the first quote Further looks back years when most insurers look back years of claims Finally why would a theft which was beyond our control and a very rare occurrence paid out by company impact on an rate Overall a distasteful experience and a complete waste of time  
 I purchased my brand new Honda in Unfortunately it was stolen on I paid cash for it and paid for the top of the line security system Honda assured me that my never be stolen So I bought it because my last was stolen from up front of my home After contacting and filing the claim they made me jump through all of their hoops and red tape They sent my claim through their special investigations unit They wanted my tax documents cell phone records bank statements and wanted witness reports I have any witnesses They asked me for the impossible felt they had to their attorney to perform scare tactics which made this whole experience even more frustrating They hired a court stenographer and I had to undergo an oath under examination Well months later I called their claims department last week to find out the status I was by Jennifer that my claim was denied due to fraud and by being non cooperative Now I am out of a and they denied me my rental coverage from the beginning I would have to drive what I have which is a Ford Explorer gas hog Then they played games like adding my son who has his own and his own Fifteen minutes ruin your life go with  
 On March I called to see if I could a tow truck because I was in an accident but not the driver or the insured by I wanted a simple 'yes if 'or 'no because ' answer then I could decide what I needed to do I was that I needed to answer a few questions and then they could tell me I was standing in the rain with an injured year old male and two others for over minutes answering 'a few' questions liar I finally gave up I could not stand there any longer trying to do whatever on the phone and keep the environment calm with all those around asking me other questions There needs to be some policy or training on this type of question incident and how this be taken care of quicker so this does not happen to others in the same situation I have had with you for many years but am questioning that decision  
 Not a customer yet but am searching is half of what my current brick and mortar company is charging A friend of mine with the Minnesota Traffic and Safety Dept me she had and had to have a windshield replaced This was not covered under comprehensive almost all brick and mortar insurers cover windshield replacements % in that they want it fixed This person me that the cost of the windshield ended up being the difference in that and her former company She quit and went back Her advice check out the policy carefully to see what is and covered I do that P S I think the only way to win at this is make your mind up that your only friend is your wallet If you had no accident and no claims then shop around every year and be prepared to make the change The longer you stay with someone the more money they make off you raising your rates each year

  reply to American client   First off you should have gone to the hospital at some point if you were injured although I understand you go that day because of your dad's funeral truly sorry for your loss and all the family related problems but then you could prove you were injured You still can Then it is your company's responsibility to pay you and then recover from And yes you an attorney to sue for your pain and suffering and for the money for your The attorney gets his money from the total sum at the end You should consult an attorney Usually the consultation is free    I myself have and I have a long and awful tale I am now to do my homework and switching for now I say that take people's money and what they pocket and spend on cutesy commercials They allow in New Jersey until about years ago they have quickly become the worst company If you actually hurt and hit by an under insured driver so they lie lie lie When they tell you that covered if you hit by an under insured driver the cheek and especially insured driver What I would really would like is them to the ** out of New Jersey I think this is why they allowed here because of these dollar policies They have forced other companies to follow suit No should have these under insured policies LISTEN CHEAP IS EXPENSIVE IN THE LONG RUN Do your homework when I made a huge mistake IS THE WORST  
 I had up until March and happily moved on to Progressive and then Esurance to cover the to I keep on my policy In February of I received a collection letter stating I owed them for my policy back in I hadn't received any correspondence from them since and I KNOW I did not owe them additional payments I have children that were teenagers at the time and there is no way I would have let something like an auto payment slip It was a big chunk of my income Now they expect me to reconstruct the time period I have never received anything from them in the last years This is so frustrating My husband passed away in September and I am livid that they are making me go back through that time period to prove I owe them this money I know I owe this debt and there a statue of limitations on something like this My state has and year limits for debt collection and this money is not owed I am irritated that is making me go through this to prove the debt was paid I never ever insure with and I encourage my children and their spouses to keep away as well  
I have discovered an overcharge on a family member's auto policy and it appears the policy has not been mailed or emailed to this individual for their review yet there is an automatic deduction from a checking account The scary thing is this has been on for a long time now There is no accountability on part The consumer is not required to be an broker and should not be taking money out of the consumer's account without prior authorization each policy period

I waited for Pop A lock and they never showed up sent them out to unlock my door and they kept changing the time they were coming and then never showed up could not company to come out to unlock my door No substitute at all It was not snowing or raining This is a basic service that most tow companies provide Then at the end of the night me to the police to come out and do it I pay a lot for my to include roadside assistance It was the worst service and it was NO SERVICE Horrible I am to search out and see if I a new company after this experience My friends are all telling me to AAA and now I am taking their advice 
 On February I received my renewal with a surcharge of dollars extra a month I called and spoke to the service department who then transferred me to the claims department and after back and forth a customer Rep from the claims department me I was being charged a surcharge because of an accident I called about on June of and I hit a parked I did call but what I was I made a turn and as I was making the turn I took a glance at my baby who was siting in the back seat coughing to make sure she was okay I heard a noise so I assumed I might have hit something me being paranoid I pulled over everything looked good Now here it is months later and is hitting me with a surcharge for an accident that happen I asked them to do an investigation and pull the phone conversation so hear what was The Rep they hold recording that long being penalize for what there were no claims no police reports and no damages or injury is calling it an accident Last I checked an accident is a sudden event such as a crash that is not planned or intended and that causes damages or injury been with them for years I tried to insured with company and has me tie down to them When the other company pulls my driving report reported an accident I had in which I sued and won as it being my fault so I have to wait for a letter from which I requested to rectified this and wait for a response for this surcharge which a Mr ** who's a supervisor promised to back to me before the day was out and here it is p m and no response been dealing with this for days now  
 This is a review for and Stillwater Co I switched my home and auto from a local company to because they were about cheaper a year than I was previously paying On my homeowners I had additional coverage for several pieces of scheduled jewelry When I was reviewing my policy with the agent I was the coverage was the same as I had before I even sent them my current policy to compare their information to All seemed in line and I purchased the policy In December I had a break in at my home and about k worth of jewelry was stolen I received a letter from Stillwater stating that they do not pay the insured amount but lowest amount they find the item for My k family heirloom bracelet is now being   replaced   for k Do not switch to unless you have someone look over your documents I would've never agreed to this type of coverage if I would've known that they do not pay the insured amount I also found out that my policy only covers on watches jewelry and guns Anything else is up to k so all of my other jewelry that was stolen not be replaced  
 So you know how brags about your windshield fixed for free Well I had a chip caused by a truck fixed for and charged me point on my driving record and I it removed They raised my semi annual premium and when I tried to company's policy they rated me higher because of the credit charged by It take years to off my record I never do business with the divisive crooks again But for the next years I make it my mission to tell this story at least times and hopefully cost them a lot of business  
 I rented a from Ace Rent A who also scams companies at your cost by submitting more claims on top of what damage you submitted on your claim Before I rented the I contact VISA as they promoted their service Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver to understand the terms VISA in case of an accident I would be covered if I used my VISA card to rent the On day of return the rear right turn signal plastic cover was damaged backing out of a parking spot were others parked too close to the rental I filed a claim through VISA provided all information to Ace Rent A as required and as a courtesy I called to inform them that I submitted a claim via VISA for the rental from Ace Rent A Apparently both VISA and paid the claim not only for the rear signal light housing but also for a paint job on the not around the cracked plastic parts + labor Now I have a record showing I have a paid claim by which in turn means more expensive rates THANKS Great that you overpay on our behalf on bogus claims Now I know why people pay higher rates to cover for your mistakes be your customer ever again

 is the worst Especially if you purchase through the Wappingers Fall branch in New York The office manager there Laura is nasty and should be fired understandable why her sales team is horrible Attitude reflects leadership They lie about what they are putting on your policy and they lie about what is on your policy They put things on your policy that you ask for and they ask you about the things you are supposed to have They take advantage of consumers and put all the responsibility on the consumer to find what dishonest thing they did The regional directors know their sales people are wrong but refuse to take responsibility Beware when purchasing a policy lacks integrity I wish I would have never involved with them not worth saving bucks I rather pay more than deal with their customer service and their sneaky sales tactics 
 I was trying to a rate quote for adding my son as an additional driver and the website clearly   Request a rate quote   After a couple minutes I an email from stating that   Your policy automatically extends coverage to relatives in your household and regular operators of your s Your son must be added as a covered driver Your new premium is x    which is more than what I am currently paying I called them back and explained that he does not drive a and I was only checking then they sent me email stating   If you would like to remove your son from your policy proof of other is required    I have been troubled by multiple times and now I am planning to switch to company pretty soon  
   INSURE WITH I have had the WORST experience with this week I bought a policy with them in November and a month later they tripled my premium First I was it was because company reported that I was in an accident in as an uninsured driver and it was showing up on my driving record For the record I in an accident nor was any I own in they correct the premium cost until the other company sent them a letter The other company shows no record of any accident so they send a letter Then tells me that on my driving record Except the state says I have a perfect driving record and nothing is on my record So then tells me the report came from me that when I was filling out my application I I was in an accident And that there is nothing I do about it Excuse me why would I say I was in an accident that I in I am filing a complaint with the MA commissioner INSURE WITH  
 On January my was totaled My policy is supposed to cover days rental at a day or up until The claims adjustor from initially approved a short term rental I asked for and got after some rigamarole an extension Then I had to wrangle with him to one They extended until Feb th It is now February th and I still have not received a settlement from the other company I have kept appraised of all the circumstances and delays as they occurred and still have to fight to a response and an extension each time I need it I have had the rental for two weeks and have been informed that they extend three days and that is it At point they me they only honor the rental agreement if the is repairable not totaled which makes absolutely no sense They are aware that I have a I want to purchase they are aware of the innumerable delays and the fact that I cannot purchase without the settlement money despite the fact that I verbally and in writing released the to the other company had the towed to a salvage company and it has now been located Needless to say it be a while before I see any settlement money and I will in all likelihood lose the opportunity to purchase the I want because of all the delays  
 Rear ended by driver he was a very nice man but he know his pay me nothing for my Sad  
 I've had a horrible experience with First they sent out an appraiser who works for insurers who never physically inspected my and then provided a ridiculously low diminished value less than % of three independent adjusters My factory recertified now has a frame related clamp marks mismatched paint and a damaged history report It appears that they would rather spend thousands of dollars on attorneys to steam roll consumers I am equally prepared to fight back and spend thousands out of my pocket to fight back Perhaps it is time for other consumers to fight back and an anti campaign should be started I be prepared to invest in such an effort once organized so future consumers ripped off  
 I was involved in an accident where the other driver was intoxicated and arrested and was % at fault The owner has for the The claims adjuster not authorize repairs or a rental replacement for me until they inspect my I understand and agree with this The claims adjuster is busy and have the time to inspect the until next week   maybe he could squeeze me in   I was The earliest an appointment was available for an on site adjuster was days later than the date of the incident In the meantime I have had to pay someone to remove the front bumper and valance and use   duct tape   to aim the head light so that it point into the sky I am very disappointed with the level of service that they are providing Or rather not providing All the commercials with the little lizard and notes about high customer satisfaction ratings are false If you want an company that is professional after you have to make a claim do not use They are a sham The money that should to be used to staff and pay for the claims the purpose of is being use for the commercials Be aware of this company wait until you have to make a claim and find out the hard way I am looking for an attorney to represent me on this matter  
  ripped me off The claims adjusters are unethical and make excuses for why they are refusing to pay for all of the damage to your like   It must have had a gas leak before it hit   Yeah sure I was driving around in a with a gas leak BEFORE the accident The was only few years old and I even had the Manager of the Dealership that I my serviced at regularly provide with a statement saying that there was no prior gas leak and they still refused to fix it That the only thing they refused to fix but it was the most expensive repair I am so glad I am no longer a customer of They were happy to send me off in a leaking gas because it would have been expensive to repair and they needed that money to pay for all those cute commercials Shame on you  
 I recently contacted my homeowners company Nationwide in obtaining rate information for my which were currently insured with Nationwide's rate for the same amount of usage on both and a better and more coverage policy provided with me with a savings every months I then contacted in regards of cancelling my policy on the An agent gave me the sob story of   Oh we are sorry to hear you that you are leaving But before you do change your mind let me see if we try to beat out Nationwide's quotes   I gave her the same info regarding the usage that I had on my when I first and she quoted me and additional extra I informed her that I be saving even more if I switched to Nationwide which was scheduled for the Jan Now the fun begins I received the notices regarding the warnings of lapse and   Sorry to hear you leave    Then weeks later I received a bill for the difference on a bill when I was originally informed that I had no outstanding amount I contacted in regards and was informed that the bill was due to recent changes on my usage when the AGENT was trying to save me on a QUOTE I spoke to a supervisor Mr Steven ** and was informed that nothing be done that I still have to make the difference of a payment was not very helpful in resolving this matter due to the CON ARTIST work of this agent Those who have BEWARE and fall for their schemes  
 My rate went up last month and when I called to find out why I was that I needed to fill out a mileage report that had been mailed to me I informed them that I had never received a mileage report and they that they would send me one That was fine but I them that I would not be paying my monthly premium until I received form and to cancel my automatic payment that was to be deducted from my bank account the next week The CSR that she cancelled my auto pay arrangement and when I asked her for a confirmation # on that she that they give confirmation #'s but that she had made notes on my account I was a little leery about taking her word for that with no other proof but there was not much that I could do So week later I was checking my bank account balance and sure enough took the money out of my account automatically that they were not supposed to Now my account would be overdrawn as I did not allow for the amount that PROMISED me that they would not take out and pending payments are to go into overdraft because of this When I called and explained to the CSR what had happened she sorry that the money could not be put back into my account I asked for a Supervisor and was that none of them were available even though my bank account was now to be overdrawn I finally a Supervisor on the phone today the next day and she was very blase and unemotional and me that they could not put money back in my account and that there were no notes on my account about cancelling the auto pay as if she were reading a script Exactly why I asked for a confirmation verification the week before which they refused to give me She kept saying that the mileage form was on its way I asked her how that was supposed to help me cover my bank account and she kept saying that the mileage report was on its way to me I have been a loyal customer of for over years but their Customer Service has gone downhill and they only seem to spend all of their time coming up with clever commercials instead of serving their customers needs I am switching companies immediately If a class action lawsuit is ever brought against IN  
 I have been insured with for almost years In that time I have made mistake and tried to pay my bill after it had been cancelled I called when I found out and they informed me I would have to start a brand new policy as my name had been taken out of the system Also I billed in SC for not having for days From that point on I have not had a claim any missed payments anything Recently my monthly bills started to double in cost When I called to inquire about this they informed me that since I had been sent a cancellation notice they were trying to help me ahead of the game a little bit and charging me double payments I have received the cancellation notices because my wife recently was laid off and with us living in a huge tourist industry there is almost no hiring in the   off season    I called to see what I could work out with them as I did not want to lose my I was that if I could pay the normal payment nothing would happen and I would have Four days later I checked my email to find that had cancelled me for nonpayment I called them and asked them how could this be possible the check had cleared my bank I gave them the name of the agent I had talked to and they were able to research and find the call I was put on hold for almost minutes as they were   looking to see what we do    After this time I was my policy would be reinstated and that my next bill would be my normal payment Three days later I yet cancellation notice telling me I still owed that rest of the balloon payment and my next payment was to be even more They gave me weeks to pay They not answer to what was originally and tell me there is nothing they do I have been if I do not pay I still owe for what was covered  
 I have an old truck that I use to to and from work So all I need is cheap auto so that my registration or driver's license suspended quoted me at a month which was really cheaper than the others I was happy and gave them my debit card # and they took my money out immediately Two days later was debited from my bank account According to them when I called my credit report was not too great so they had to raise my premium DOUBLE But they ran my credit report when I solicited the quote I mean why do they ask you for your social security number And also why take the money out of my account without my permission I think is the most shadiest thing ever invented It is a form of robbing people and I hope someday a real   for the people   politician steps up and makes optional  
 My was stolen It was found It was sent to an investigator as all thefts are The investigator intimidated me and harassed me until I had to drop a claim trying to tell me it was fraud for having somebody staying with me and not putting them on my policy WORST co ever I wish I hadn't switched from Progressive to save the a month My was paid off a month prior to it being stolen I was devastated The adjuster that went to see the when it was found claimed it was drivable yet it had to be towed back to my house and when I brought it to the mechanic it had a blown engine PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE research prior to picking an company Rates everything  
 I worked for last year Thankfully I was able to out about three months ago I worked in the general claims department So if you are that anyone handle your claim when you call in this is the department I was in So the people in this department work in an inbound call center The call center is ALWAYS holding calls On top of the calls that we must answer we all have a pending diary to work These are your claim files We have about of them assigned to us claims assigned to us and dozens of inbound calls to answer Think we are working your file Guess what We are not Most of the time when we want to work your file we an email from a supervisor saying that we are not allowed to make any outbound calls because we are so busy So once again your claim is not to be worked So if you decide to have through or you have an accident with someone who has be prepared to work your claim by yourself Oh and when the agents tell you they cannot run a plate check to find out the other person's information because not filing through that is a lie We run it We are to say this because the company does not want to spend money The only time we say yes is when you have been with the company for at least five years That is BS considering YOU are paying premium

 I was involved in accidents two times in my life in and First accident happened when I turned right from the parking garage on the street and decided to make wide U turn from the opposite line and hit my on the side It was definitely the fault the other but decided to make it as soon as they hear my accent on the phone The second claim happened right on January Some teenager was speeding on the residential undivided street with mi h and hitting my from opposite lane taking away my left mirror and parts of my from the left front They were talking about responsibility from the beginning because the street was undivided but later they decided to change the claim and put all responsibility on me  
 Called to add rental to my policy I was by the customer service rep that was not necessary as I have comprehensive which makes me eligible for per day for rental coverage Rented a for days as a result of an accident A day before the return of the rental I called to an update on policy and was shocked to be I had no rental coverage After careful explanation to the customer service rep and a supervisor I was there is nothing they could do even it was noted that I called I also made sure to advise them that I was a specific amount for the coverage per day which was and it was seem unusual that I would be aware of this coverage amount unless this was to me by a representative In was hit with a fee of by the rental company Why should I pay for someone else's mistake and misguided information That is unethical and unacceptable  
 The cost of my premium has gone up without any rhyme or reason because of this unwarranted increase I decided to take my business elsewhere My auto policy was active from To buy a new policy for the next six months my premium was for the first month installment I chose not to pay this premium and instead purchased auto from a competitor company is now billing me indicating I owe them for the new policy premium even though I have informed them verbally and in writing that I no longer want an policy through They insist I owe them for the new policy premium because I was automatically enrolled in a new policy even though I elected not to pay the new premium and have purchased auto through company  
 Well I opened an account with and was charged a reasonable amount for the policy I was extremely happy until I received an email two weeks later saying that to contact them about the policy immediately So after I contacted them they me there was a mistake on my policy and that to be charged dollars more as a time fee and then I be charged monthly afterwards When I cancelled to go with a different auto I was I have to pay bucks because they had to adjust my policy for their mistake so pissed off WHY SHOULD I PAY BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYEE TYPED IN MY DATE OF BIRTH INSTEAD OF AND I HAVE TO PAY A FEE FOR THEIR MISTAKE

 My was broken into Someone popped the driver door lock and gained access to my The person also into my trunk and stole a PlayStation as well as some cash I had I was planning to give the items as a gift and now I can't As if they done the person slashed both my front leather seats When I arrived at my I noticed the doors open and the seats were soaking wet Probably from the freezing temperature and snow I an estimate the next day The adjuster DID NOT ask anything regarding what happened or what parts are damaged He seemed as though he was pretty new as he constantly asked his peers for help I ended up with an estimate that says I have to pay % betterment They want me to pay of out of pocket Even though I have comprehensive coverage When I asked why they gave me this story about wear and tear on my seat Well there is no wear and tear on my seat That is the tears from the person who vandalized my They seem to understand that demanded two supervisors without any response so far and am demanding a re evaluation They have been completely unfair with me with this claim I understand betterment and how a state law however % is absolutely ridiculous Still waiting for an answer The check they have offered me even cover half of the parts alone without labor  
 Late response on claim no result Then CarFax already knew and recorded with accident which I never expected for almost three years I to know today in appraisal of my at a dealership Their service is not any help integrated either Unprofessional customer service I used to like this company in service quality with their online effectiveness now I am very disappointed with overall service for not affordable price anymore  
  took two payments from my bank account when I only processed payment The amounts were even different That took two seconds But when I called to the problem fixed they it would take five days to an okay to put the money back Not to mention how long it would take to actually the money into my account No tell me that they take money out that fast but no way to put it back as fast Fix your screw ups give me excuses why it be done And quit taking people's money without their permission

  client dropped a lb box spring on the highway that my auto impacted @ mph The auto was damaged on front end undercarriage and left and right sides Auto was taken to body shop where all damaged was identified and front end alignment was requested due to strange noise observed after impact After picking up auto from body shop the noise was still noticeable and louder which was thought to be noise from wheels Auto was inspected by a certified ASE mechanic who immediately identified the noise coming from a damaged wheel bearing Auto was taken to a mechanical repair facility to disassemble for inspection for damage resulting from the impact and for adjuster observation After several days I was informed that the supplement claim was denied due to the damaged wheel bearing being due to normal wear and tear The auto was picked up and taken to an alternate ASE mechanic for a visual inspection where it was determined that the wheel parts had not been disassembled for several years The previous repair facility was contacted where I was informed that not only was the wheel and associated parts not removed for visual inspection as requested but the adjuster never arrived to view or inspect The adjuster made the opinion and decision without ever visually inspecting the even after two previous ASE mechanics verbally testified that it was probable that the wheel bearing incurred damaged from the impact  
 Car stranded at midnight called for Roadside Assistance repeatedly for minutes but put on hold No money for tow truck had to hitch a ride lucky we were not abducted or killed I am furious with and I am still waiting to hear back from them Would NEVER recommend them next day had to contact a wrecker and was that many of these companies are being dropped by wrecker services for not paying for services for days Wish someone would have me this before we sat on the side of the highway freezing to death hoping that no would stop to rob or kill two senior ladies DEAR god I am PISSED  
 I have been with off and on for the past years I had an accident in which someone hit my and left the scene of the accident months ago after I updated my policy a few days prior Originally was very pleasant with initiating my claim but after the first few days of my claims existence I was my claim was under investigation because of the recent policy renewal Two weeks ago denied my claim stating I have not provided enough information to prove when the accident occurred I called my States Commissioner who opened a claim on the way has handled my claim and notified me to tell they were under investigation hour after I notified they were under investigation I received a call from stating my claim has been reopened Since that date has requested phone records witness testimony from people who were not present during the accident but knows when the accident occurred and multiple testimonies from me They have been extremely hard to on the phone and never return my calls They are looking for anything possible to decline my claim

 I was a policy holder of several years with no claims month for some unknown reason they did not charge my card for my monthly premium and never informed me so I realize it had not gone through Before that happened though I had hit a parked in the middle of the night first accident in years and reported it The policy lapsed for day before I realized and reinstated again this was after the accident claimed they verify when my accident happened so they pay the poor people I cancelled and moved on to Allstate  
 I was coffee at Dunkin Donuts when a policy holder hit my while parked I argued I need a rental since I had a friend to take me to work They offered me a day called   cash out of pocket   They   Let's start out with days if it happens to take longer call we write out one    been calling them for the last weeks fighting with them because they want to give the additional days days In total days of repair They do ANYTHING for me And to think my wife's family has them HA I tell everybody about my experience GONE a shame they treat people like that  
 I was rear ended by a insured driver a week ago I have USAA The claims adjuster is beyond rude and asks questions that have nothing to do with the accident like who's my employer and my health Of course I answer and the adjuster then asks do I have Medicaid Are you serious I you that I have health through my employer She's very snappy and rude The insured rear ended me at a red light MPH My back hurts my neck hurts and my shoulder hurts The claims adjuster could care less My company USAA has taken over and they recoup the money from she me grateful to have USAA on my side I feel so alone in this now to a chiropractor x a week to help me with the pain The field adjuster called me today and me my was a total loss and offered USAA not a total loss and that the Value is What is wrong with  
 My was broken into for the second time in less than days I had to pay the first time it happened so when it happened again I knew it would cost me about the same picks up the over the weekend and then they are calling me for an authorization I tell the on site rep Evan I not have the monies for a few weeks He handle it call I call They tell me talk to the body shop Body shop Greenfield Auto in Newark NJ says   You have to pay a day for storage    and then they say   We usually charge you    Then I call Evan's supervisor for some help He tells me did nothing wrong So I am telling him it was never explained the cost to keep the if I could not pay Some background the first time this happened the shop was busy and it took over two weeks for the work to done and I had to wait and then extended the rental time This time the shop is slow so they are rushing my claim through to paid And here is my problem Instead of you cyborg idiots seeing everybody as a dollar bill take a minute and listen to people and explain what is on I already them make it right or I be gone from I also post to any social media that has an outlet to voice my perspective I may even start a blog You rush me I am the customer  
 First started when my wife contacted about a price rate if she would renew her policy that was current when company offered her a cheaper rate per month and a lower down payment Even with her being with for years with no tickets or accidents they were not willing to give her a better price So days before her policy was to expire she contacted to cancel her policy and her info sent to the new company for her new policy After talking to the rep and asked that she be charged to her account because she was canceling her policy with and she was no she and that they were sorry for losing her business well next thing we find out that on the expiration date of the policy her bank account was charged for a policy she canceled We contacted about the charges and it was for renewal of the policy We them we had a new company because they give her a good rate and that she canceled them a week ago They my wife that they would have to investigate her claim and even with email from showing they received cancellations and that they sent the info to the new company They tell her they have any phone recording of the conversation and with them withdrawing her money without permission they caused her bank account to be overdrawn and growing daily Till her SSI check goes in on the st which by that time clean out her account and take away from her her meds and stuff for our newborn son trying to see if anyone else has run into this same problem before and what they did to resolve it This is hard on us as working hard to keep a roof over our heads and she pays the and stuff for our son while I cover all the other bills but the crap that pulled on my wife that was loyal and paid her policy on time every month thru her bank account and they pull this BS on her because she drops them because the rate was too high for someone that has a clean driving record with no tickets and no claims the whole time she was with them And now they say all they give her back is when we sent them the bank statement showing that they withdraw How dare they keep some of her money they had no right taking in the first place  
 Back in Oct there was an accident with my I filed a claim and was the claim was denied because I had no coverage I online and they had a wrong on my nd time this has happened I let them know what the problem was and they assured me that it would be taken care of and the wrong taken off my Fast forward to today I have tried numerous times to reach company as the incorrect was not taken off my policy and they still expect me to continue to pay for this LOL WHAT And not only that they covering the correct that was in the accident I refuse to pay them dime in and not only that I have to hire an attorney to any of my money back Horrible horrible customer service I never through this company again nor would I ever recommend to anybody Something has to be done to stop this kind of practice Oh and also they made sure they took a payment out of my account today which I did put a stop payment on as well  
 My year old daughter was rear ended while stopped at a red light by a insured They offered to pay for a rental as they are required to when they are at fault The problem came up when I explained to them that my daughter is only and so cannot drive a rental I have to give her my to drive and take the rental myself I am '    and a big man I do not fit in anything less than a full sized All they would authorize was a sub compact Then they they would do me a favor and authorize a small SUV because that is what my daughter was driving she was driving a Ford Escape When I tried to explain to them that anything less than a full sized would do me no good they stonewalled me What good does it do to rent a I cannot use I do NOT recommend Any company that not listen to reason and not accommodate such a minor request is not worth having I use AAA Primarily because when I was hit by someone who had AAA it was such a painless experience to my truck fixed So I switched coincidentally enough from to AAA Now I have better that costs me less and is far more accommodating  
 I placed the claim on Monday at while sitting in my stuck in a ditch on the side of I right outside of Jacksonville Florida After spinning around in a times and almost dying because of three lanes of mph traffic headed right towards me this experience was anything but satisfying Let's start out by it taking minutes to describe my accident to the gentleman on the phone problem # and then FINALLY being able to be transferred to a tow truck sent to us After minutes of trying to tell the person on the phone that a I know my exact location because I was still in shock and b that NO I out of my in the median of a road with MPH traffic on either side of me to try and find some sort of mile marker or road sign Sorry if risking my life trying to make your minimum wage job a little easier seem worth it problem # & # THEN I ask the gentleman to please set me up to have a rental sent because I knew my would not be able to be driven hours back to our Orlando area residence I am then we do not have rental coverage on my policy problem # Well kinda funny because when I set up my coverage I the woman to set me up with ALL the   bells and whistles   because you could never be too safe Guess rental coverage included in her idea of   all the bells and whistles   Anyways I okay well then how about the tow truck because he be bringing the back to the Orlando area we could hitch a ride with him Here comes problem # The woman asks me who is with me and I her that I had myself my partner and our two dogs small show dog Boxer under pounds and our pound Yorkshire Terrier She put me on hold for twenty minutes let's make that problem # and then comes back to tell me that it was against policy that only passengers were allowed in the cab I then asked her what she thought I should do since that make sense to me because what did she suppose I do with my two dogs that might as well be my children She have an answer and me to please hold problem # for minutes BTW my phone is about to die at this time and keep in mind still sitting in the median of I with MPH traffic on either side sounds peachy it After back on the phone she then explained that it was   just policy   BUT and here's the bright idea of a smart minimum wage paid EMPLOYEE that I could leave my dogs strapped in the on top of a flat bed truck traveling on I at MPH WITH the windows up because during a downpour Well I aware that was a company that condoned animal cruelty because I sure if you guys knew that it is ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to leave a dog just like a child in a locked with the windows up problem # # Okay so let's keep going We then decide to try and wait on the tow truck and see what he says and if he take the dogs then I might have to stand on the side of the road with my two dogs and wait for a taxi to come me since that seems safer and more reliable than the service and the companies affiliated with Alright so about hours pass and I start to worry The state trooper has already left us because he's even concerned with sitting on the median of I in the middle of rush hour with MPH traffic on either side feel my aggression yet I then call the number back to see about the tow truck and they tell me that the tow truck find us and has returned back to the shop because he   couldn't a hold of me   that's a detail you should remember even though I have been sitting in my and here's where I remind you on the MEDIAN OF I WITH MPH TRAFFIC ON EITHER SIDE So then I call the state trooper and ask him what the mile marker was and he looked it up and gave me the numbers & So I then give them that information and they tell me that sending him   right out   Okay so here goes by TWO hours and he arrived problem # ish So I call back and they tell me that he should be there in less than minutes AN HOUR LATER problem # maybe lost track he gets there and puts my partner and DOGS in the cab right away to them out of harm's way and safely puts my on to the flat bed in a timely manner THANK YOU TOW TRUCK MAN So we FINALLY leave the accident site at Did you add that up That was over FIVE HOURS THAT I WAS SITTING IN MY IN THE MEDIAN OF I WITH MPH TRAFFIC ON EITHER SIDE Well That a fun experience at all and YOUR EMPLOYEES help tiny little bit With no help from your company finally on my way home with my two dogs and partner Remember that detail from earlier About the time I finally was SUPPOSEDLY had a tow truck coming my way Well the tow truck guy randomly mentions that they did not receive the call to come out until *screams* Ahem anyways I finally back to the Orlando area around Here's day two for those that kept up I call in the morning to set up an appointment to have an adjuster come out to assess the damage to the so I it fixed After talking to a woman for a few moments she tells me that they NOT be sending a tow truck to pick up my to bring to the dealership to have it accessed because they already have deemed it TOTALED problem # Well funny how exactly would you know that if you seen it Humph I then explain that the reason we could not drive it yesterday was because the front and back bumper were hanging off AND I have two bald back tires That does not mean it is Totaled So then she   Well if it totaled YOU drive it to the dealership problem #    OH MY I aware that a was either totaled OR perfectly safe to drive SO then after her threatening to hang up on me because I so happen to angry because of the way this whole situation has panned out i e LOOK ABOVE I talk to a supervisor and he sets up a tow truck to come out to the residence that the is located to bring it to the dealership and that the tow truck should be there around or awesome things are looking up Right WRONG Mind you this my residence my partner's her residence is miles closer than mine from Jacksonville So I go there to wait for the tow truck and next thing I know pm and I seen a tow truck problem # I call and really trying to be as patient as possible and they tell me that the tow truck find us and apparently called but a hold of us no missed calls and doing nothing but sitting around waiting for the tow truck MISSING MY WHOLE DAY AT WORK SO they send out and he'll be there shortly Did you know that dealerships close at most of the time And that usually when you have a bumper falling off a Mazda RX kinda hard to pick up with an everyday tow truck Think about that for a second At an EVERYDAY TOW TRUCK pulls up and I have to laugh I show him my and explain that to work he agrees and leaves Ten minutes later I receive a call from some lady at the tow truck business telling me that a the reason they send out that truck was because they have any flat bed trucks working that day and that the truck that was sent out was the first available slot all day Then why would you send out anyways for ** and giggles seem to smart OR efficient to me She insists on calling me SIR even though she confirmed that my name is CRYSTAL and did you notice what she The first truck available What happened to the truck that find us and a hold of us Seems a little off to me been lie after from you guys and really tired of the runaround and really unsure of what exactly I am paying you every month for So here I am now with a still sitting with busted bumpers and bald tires telling you that I am VERY DISSATISFIED with your customer service but as well if I am not contacted by the end of the business day tomorrow if you keep up I not only be setting up a cancellation date on ALL of my policies that I hold with you but as well I be contacting my lawyer to seek further resolution We have also been waiting a month for my now and they tried to give it back to me half ** They did the bare minimal and even fix the deep scratches painted over them I mean in every aspect is a joke This even the half of it but sure you the picture Every employee minus a   G   who was helpful in calming the matter claimed to be a supervisor but yet is unheard of and I reach her again Seems to me until they papers from an attorney they could care less about anyone or anything other than collecting a paycheck which clearly must suck because they all seem to hate their jobs BY THE WAY I know you have recorded conversations to look back through so give you the names of the wonderful employees you should really consider retraining Crystal In your accident towing department William ** Jazmine Andrew ** Adjuster 
 I a new and my current company rate for full coverage was about so I needed to look for something cheaper All I have ever heard about is that their rates are cheap so I call in for a quote I done with everything She quotes me which is great so I tell her I have all the money and she proceeds to badger me So I end up splitting the payments onto three cards Then I ask her if it makes a difference having someone else's name on the title with me a question she should have asked beforehand not driver name on title that helped me finance the She then gets that other person on the phone for information on three way and states that it bring my up to a month and how my friend should pay that because it is her fault that the quote went up in the first place This should not have gone the way it did and the rep was very unprofessional That was the worst experience I have ever had I then called back cancelled my policy and refunded for all my payments I now have Farm Bureau for a month full coverage with both our names on the that is way better That woman should not work for them at all  
 Was rear ended by a client in early July They have paid for the seat replacement and repairs at their shop which were done poorly we've returned + times to things that fell apart fixed again and have appt to go back for it to be re repaired again Since FL is a no fault state my has paid all medical which ended up being more than has paid We have been trying to recover depreciation value on our since it sustained major frame damage and over k in damage We have left voice mails and emails for the last + weeks with not return email or phone call We have even contacted the bosses of the people who contact us back is a joke I have never experienced such poor customer service We were trying to do this without a lawyer but it seems that is the only way to through to this crappy company The accident even my fault but instead of having a hassle free experience I have to deal with this crap now I would not recommend to anyone  
 I own a Jaguar I have issues with the local dealership which recently performed repairs on my Soon thereafter issues occurred that I felt was related to the work performed by that dealership I asked to have my towed to a secondary mechanic of my choice miles difference and was denied that benefit by They only covered a TOW to the dealership I felt caused my problem I be researching coverage by an company that allow me to tow my when disabled to a mechanic of my choice not the closest possibly incompetent business  
 Was hit from behind by a insured person Traffic was stopped and this person hit me so hard he went under my Solara never had an accident before this one Guy lied and gave me policy number with All State but then I a call from a week later saying they accept fault for the accident They refused to give me the guy’s policy number but gave a claim # they do team adjusting no main person I’m this tactic is used to confuse people they exasperated and give up I had to drive to adjuster at their chosen shop Guy didn’t have a loaner for me me to call customer service for one I had to walk over a mile with back injury to home From body shop I chose Waited days for a I had to go pick up Medical adjuster kept harassing me to settle and threatening they won’t pay if I don’t see a doctor immediately I explained to him I went to the ER and I was looking for an orthopedic doctor in my new state I wasn’t to any quack simply because they wanted to close their file I saw the Ortho the following week and was to go to physical therapy as I had whiplash Money offered by wasn’t to cover that cost so I didn’t the physical therapy and am feeling it now Medical adjuster kept telling me what was considered normal for my type of accident so their doctors now too insinuating I was trying to take them it seemed He also me I would have to speak to adjuster to reimbursed for time off work He also kept pushing for my personal to pay the hospital bills and I assured him they would bill back to as I instructed them to do Wanting this whole pain behind me I made the mistake of settling on the medical before my was fully repaired Friday I signed on the medical settlement which was close to nothing and did not cover my time off work which I can’t because verbiage on doc says all claims he me that was only med claims lied The following Wednesday when my was due to be ready I a call from some guy named Jared at and he makes a stupid remark about how I must be from the east coast because there is some rust on my exhaust pipe and tells me that I need to pay the cost my share to it fixed because they are bettering my by putting new exhaust I absolutely not I am not at fault on this accident I was stopped in traffic and their client is % at fault I should not have to pay out of my own pocket to fix damage simply because my wasn’t new which was the other thing they when I questioned their thinking I went to the body shop and took pictures of my exhaust and asked the body shop owner if he would need to replace the exhaust if there were no rust on the pipe and he yes because the guy hit me so hard that he bent all the exhaust piping which bent my catalytic converter and broke a piece of the muffler off He didn’t think I should have to pay anything and me he saw them do this to client who had to go to small claims court suing the person who hit her I tried calling the regional manager and only smart Alec people answering the phone and trying to push me on other people and they all the same thing it sounded like a script I called the State board and asked what rule is on the books that allows them to charge the victim like this They called me back and there isn’t one Sometimes this happens in civil cases but has nothing to do with the state code and they encouraged me to file a complaint I filed with them the State’s Atty office and the Consumer Board I also contacted a friend who has been doing claims for over yrs for a large carrier and he me this is called Bad Faith practices What they are doing is ** and I shouldn’t have had to pay a dime To make matters worse the loaner I had was only to be mine for day and there was a hold on my own credit card for that even though it’s all supposed to be covered by I wrote a letter to the president of the company Tony Nicely and sent it certified mail today not sure it do much I a letter in the mail today from loser from advising they received my complaint from the board and basically me the same crap my was older and they me so blah blah blah It’s a well cared for and no issues until accident I paid to my fixed using the money I on the pain and suffering so they made their money back like they wanted it was almost to the penny My is not the same my wheel doesn’t straighten out by itself like it did before I didn’t paid for time off work and they refused to provide me diminished value I’m so angry because the guy who hit me was a liar to start with and the was his mom’s or so he and was very old and beat up so I know he probably wouldn’t pay me the money even if I win a case I am all for a class action lawsuit against GIECO They are criminal and it needs to stop The guy who hit me has no idea the crap I have gone through A month without my and fighting with to it repaired and my not the same and probably thinks he is covered but is screwing him because now he is sued and he thinks his covered him as it should have They are beyond horrible DONT USE THEM  
 I was with in spring of for approx months for basic on a year old Toyota The policy was cancelled by myself the last week of August as the car’s engine seized and it was towed to a junk yard month later I purchased a year old Mitsubishi Montero Sport was called and policy #** was set up with initial st month’s payment to be taken out directly from my bank account several days later I received a later dated welcoming me to with banking agreement outlined The day before the letter arrived called my residence and they were sorry but they changed their mind and were cancelling my policy as upon review they decided I was uninsurable I was shocked and asked the reasons behind the sudden change when I had a policy with them less than a month ago The rep they treat every policy as a new and review it Because I had a claim on the prior policy and I had a lapse cancellation and they did not like my past driving record I replied that made no sense as # I had to cancel my policy as the was no longer registered # my claim was a cracked windshield and I do believe against the law to drive with a cracked windshield # my driving record which was not good was the same as it was when I had my policy in the spring The prior speeding tickets and offenses were over years ago and there were no new charges After arguing my point it basically came down to the fact that whomever insured me before with did not check my driving history and they all of sudden decided I worth the risk to insure and should not have been insured before YET I was accepted on the prior policy and had a letter arrive the next day welcoming me for my new policy They give and they take it away Makes no sense to me that I was welcomed twice then kicked out Good way to do business Welcome to Massachusetts  
 My story begins when I was in a three accident three weeks ago I was the last in line of the accident I called to report the accident and the lady who I spoke with was friendly enough She asked me basic questions How many were involved Were you injured Do you remember the types and colors of the other involved Did you their information Those were the only questions involved no detailed questions Two days later tow truck company picked up my and took it to the preferred auto shop They only gave me two options for the auto shop so I chose the closest to my home After a week and a half and no communication from I called the shop I asked what the status was and what exactly they were doing Veronica from the shop no affiliation with was very helpful She emailed me the full report of what the representative ordered to be worked on and Veronica went over each item with me line by line Veronica was very friendly and helpful Upon over the report I noticed that only the front end of the had been inspected and repaired Although majority of the damage was in the front end since I hit the back of the in front of me I was concerned about my driver door Veronica gave me the estimator's Marcos ** cell number and I immediately contacted him He answer so I left a message Two days later he returned my call and I asked him why a full inspection was not conducted I him that the two in front of me lost license plates and parts of their as did I and that I remembered things flying past me and hitting my door Marcos me that it possible for the items to fly past me and hit my in the midst He then me that he fix the top of my where my paint was all bubbled because that part of the accident I even mention the top of my I Marcos that I was not to bring up the bubbled paint because it has been a problem for the past year and that not stupid I understand that accidents do not cause paint to bubble Marcos was extremely passive aggressive with me and his poor customer service skills were surprising to me He want to hear my story nor would he compromise in any way like a good customer service representative would do Good customer service is listening to the customer trying to understand the situation and trying to rectify the situation A week later I received a call saying that my was ready At this time my has now been in the shop for three weeks I went to the shop to pick up my but immediately saw the large dent in my driver door I them I pay for it since it properly fixed Veronica then advised me to contact Marcos' supervisor Marc ** She me that he should have emailed me Later that evening I found out that he had emailed my husband and my husband never brought it to my attention I emailed Marc ** telling him that I had a concern before I could pay for and pick up my I also replied to his original email sent to my husband It was a survey on Marcos ** It consisted of four questions Did Marcos contact you prior to inspecting your After inspecting your did Marcos contact you and review the estimate During the process did Marcos answer all your questions and advise you of our goal to provide industry leading customer service If you had to call Marcos did he answer the phone and if not did he return your call in a timely manner Well of course all my answers were negative The beginning of this letter explains this When I received a call back from Marc day later he seem surprised about my survey email He me that Marcos failed in communication but say anything about bringing it to his attention or fixing the situation like normal supervisors It seemed as though he was to brush it off his shoulders and care at all I then him about the dent that Marcos did not want to fix and more importantly how Marcos treated me over the phone I him about his paint remark and how he was passive aggressive with me and how he listen to me and kept cutting me off during the conversation Again Marc say anything about the customer service I had received from Marcos He simply me that he had inspected my that morning and that he believe that the dent was due to flying objects He me that it was a door ding Now I have dinged my door on a white pole at the gas station before And that ding is clear And it is white And it is on my door handle The dent however is in the middle of my door where concave Which means that even if I was to hit my door in that general area it would first hit the part of the door that was convex my own logical thinking However Marc would not budge and that I was wrong and that would not pay for it He me that they would not work on my any further because I had not reported any damages I Marc that when I first reported the claim that I was not asked to report damages and that not representative had contacted me after they towed my away So I was not given the chance to report any damages or go over the damages that Marcos had found before the shop began working on it Never being in this situation I am of course telling everyone about the situation and have been by numerous people that their companies always call them to go into the shop to go over all damages with the estimator Obviously this is sneaky way of doing the bare minimum and away with lies I then Marc that I was completely disappointed with customer service and that I would cancel my with them He okay Five minutes later I called The woman was helpful and me that I was being treated poorly and that I should file a complaint with Marc's supervisor and the complaint department She found out who Marc's supervisor was and gave me that information and transferred me to the complaint department I left a message on the cell of Craig ** Marc's supervisor because he answer I also received a very rude voice mail from Marcos that day telling me that if I pick up my they would charge me per day So I went after work to pick up my No walked me out to inspect my They swiped my credit card and gave me the key On the way home I noticed that the front inside of my door looked off I compared it to the other side and the driver's side was horribly misaligned I looked back at the rest of the door and the part where my seat belt comes from was totally out of place and cracked I immediately called my husband to tell him that we had to turn around When we back to the shop they were closed So I went home took pictures of the misaligned door and called Marc telling him that I was back to the shop day later Craig ** returned my call representatives seem to like to wait a day to call back I Craig the whole story but stressed that it even the dent that I was most disappointed about It was the rudeness and passive aggressiveness and poor customer service that I received from Marcos and Marc He seem to care about that part at all He of course wanted to defend the dent and me that would not pay for it Seems like all three men cared only about was the money it would cost them After three years of loyalty to this company they be there for me when I needed them I also explained to him my new findings of the inside of the door and how I believed that the inside and undercarriage were not inspected at all He me that Marc had already informed him of the situation and that Marc had inspected the inside and that there was a lie somewhere but he could assure me it with his representatives So basically he was calling me a liar He also me that since the outside of my door damaged then the misalignment of the inside of my door must be attributed to something else I him that I believe it to be common sense that when the front end of the is smashed in then more than likely to push other parts of the inward causing the misalignment of my inside door He again me I was wrong but if I wanted to take it back to the shop they would be willing to fix the misalignment Gee thank you Again poor customer service from a third representative Had they done a full and comprehensive inspection none of this would even be an issue Or maybe if they had involved me like other companies I could have brought these issues to the table during the first week My is back in the shop for a total of month Toyota could have probably built brand new Yaris by hand by now I have put in a request to cancel my at the end of my bill cycle which both Marc and Craig knew about but seem to care that they were losing a loyal customer of three years I continue to spread the word about horrendous customer service and how they even fix all of the damages from my accident which is what I thought I was paying them for throughout these three years I am also missing my sun shades which they say I must have lost Why would I take out my sun shades after the accident when I even have a representatives are liars unfair and very rude Shame on for the way they treated a loyal customer who was never late in any payments at that  
 We were in a horrible accident in June The other driver was DRUNK and insured by and we were too They totaled our We were supposed to a van and we It was days before received property compensation In Virginia that includes property inside the which tries to avoid paying We received our med pay on our own policy months They were still charging us for the totaled I met lady and she was hit by DRUNK and she the adjuster was a pain which we had the same sorry adjuster and his supervisor not worth the HASSLE My wife was with them for YEARS but we now STAY AWAY FROM THE GECKO  
 I'm not the kind to write reviews but if it keeps someone else from being a victim of this fraud take the few minutes to save the hours days & weeks of grief Please be aware that the information that you give to receive a quote online or over the phone is easily accessible to dishonest people involved with fraud Unfortunately does not have a very good verification process when they are starting a new policy They try and make the process easy for their customers and that is perfectly understandable but when you are working with SS#s and personal information there should be a policy in place to also protect their customers I could not even tell you what it would be like to have with after an auto accident because I am not willing to go that far had to cancel my policy to protect my bank funds Not to mention through the process of having to cancel debit cards I shopped around and received a quote earlier this year and have now decided to make the switch and the first day I have with them they have charged me for someone else's unpaid auto policy and are unwilling to assist in any way due to the fact that their name and DOB matches mine not even sure how they are able to charge something to your debit card that you have not authorized Please be aware that their online service is not safe for customers Whether this was identity theft or an oversight by when opening someone's policy it has cost me and hope you avoid this  
 I was in a laundromat and happened to look up in time to see a insured sideswipe my PARKED After calling my to report it they notified The following day called to my side of the story and they would talk to their client A week later after talking to their   client   she supposedly gave a DIFFERENT story so they DENIED the claim because OUR stories were different REALLY I called their   Client   and she she DID NOT deny that she sideswiped me and she had NO idea why they that I then called back and   I have her on tape and she she DID NOT deny hitting me to you    The adjuster she would call and talk to her She did call and HER to NOT talk to me anymore heard from them since Turned it over to MY and now THEY are after Go em  
 I was hit by a driver who was backing up and left a broken right light signal and a dent After negotiations with the man who he would pay for my damages I called to make a claim The reps know what they are talking about when they initially sign you up They are quick to close a claim I gave them my version of my story and sent emails to prove that the man wanted to pay out pocket and did not want to go through and still they made a decision that I was at fault Why The man   supposedly   had a witness and from the story that was it was completely false Long story short he that I rear ended him and I cancelled effective immediately I have not at fault and no record of accidents or tickets and the man who hit me has multiple traffic citations including a DUI All because he had a   witness   and I The reps have no remorse because they care needs to go out of business and I feel sorry if day they did  
 On April was rear ended by their insurer Went to Providence ER referred to personal Doctor who referred me to an Orthopedic Specialist who sent me to Physical Therapy for sessions On June was released by Orthopedic Specialist Faxed all hospital Doctors and Therapist paperwork more than three times to Claim adjuster Phyllis ** who has put me off with assorted excuses Now her supervisor is on vacation I called an Attorney George ** when the accident occurred who stated my have enough damage for an attorney My mother was in my and her health been the same since

  cancelled me without notification After which they took unauthorized EFT Now they are stalling my refund even though they admit error I wonder how many people they do this to so they profit from the interest They need class action lawsuit  
 I had SRT in my driveway the other parked on my street when someone put screws in all four tires of both SRT 's and broke the windshield an antenna on the SRT parked in the street for each set of run flat tires It took over a year for to pay me back for the tires I was charged two deductibles for incident Then last December I found my antifreeze coolant reservoir almost empty I had it reverse flushed and pressure tested Checked out perfect Two weeks later I drive to see my family in Colorado I swerve to avoid a stopped on the road and ended up in a ditch I tried to out of ditch and my engine sputtered and misfired so I popped the hood and saw fluid in my antifreeze reservoir almost empty I called to take my SRT to the auto repair shop They found the petcock had been loosened and my was sabotaged before I left Texas That was months ago I am still fighting for the truth to come out Who I file charges against or hire an attorney  
 On July I found my dream for sale at a local dealership It was brand new but last year's model and they were moving it out for a substantially discounted price I have been insured by for years and never had a claim etc I called and them I was considering changing of the on my policy I gave them the VIN number of the new and explained which was leaving my policy Note my monthly payment at that time was for full coverage on a and liability only on a that would be leaving the policy The rep me that if I bought the new today my next payment would be Then each payment thereafter would be per month Okay full coverage on new vs liability on old one new is high risk expensive brand new sports so far okay She she had saved the quote in the system and if I bought the to simply call back and tell them there is a saved quote and to enact it I bought the that afternoon and did exactly as instructed I called and had them make the change I drove out of the dealership in my brand new and hit the town After the euphoria died down to a dull roar a couple of days later I logged into my account online to confirm that my changes were in order   Next Payment Due   WOW ALL I SAY IS WOW So after I have regained the ability to breath again I do a little math per month the old way the new way days left in the month since changing to the new way That equals the I was verbally over the phone Nowhere anyone work out the numbers and come up with for any single monthly bill no matter what they do given the constants here So I call to question them I was ways from Sunday in all manner of double talking self contradicting language how I somehow owe them at the next billing cycle then the per month thereafter I could see I was nowhere I needed to be so I ended the call Later that afternoon I called again I asked the new rep to please explain to me in detail the mathematical formula that produces for next month and they simply couldn't I magically owed them in about a week and a half from now and that was that I went online and filled out some auto quote requests I promptly received phone calls this is all on a Saturday mind you from several reputable companies and worked out a deal with of them which provided superior coverage for under per month with an initial payment of under to started I selected my new insurer their direct contact info and them to save my quote because they would likely be hearing from me within the hour Now I make my third minute call to Called gave them all of my info to verify I was really me and when they asked what they could do for me I replied   Yes you cancel my policy effective midnight tonight    She was very sorry to hear I was leaving and would connect me to someone who could take care of that request for me right away hmmm never offered to connect me to anyone else before now did they Here is why They connected me to a tier talk them down off the ledge hostage negotiation specialist type He asked if I would mind telling him why I was leaving so I him my story He was very attentive and sympathetic as I explained the reasons why I was leaving He admitted there was nothing he could do about the grotesque application of mathematics and inconsistencies between what I was quoted and what they later posted to my account that I owed but he understood that price was also a key factor here and he asked if I would at least allow him to attempt to offer me a new price for my coverage before I made my final decision stating that there might be something he could do and he wanted to run a few things and see what he could come up with I   well what the heck go ahead    I agree to be placed on hold and in less than minutes he comes back on with   great news   how would you like the exact same coverage for per month full coverage on both and roadside breakdown and rental coverage to boot All I have to do is stay with them and pay something at next billing date then we go to the for the rest of all eternity   Okay what's the catch    I asked Well there are new discounts for your state that exist when your policy was first written and I have applied them Hmmm very interesting Okay you keep me as a customer I went online to confirm and there are all my coverages and prices as quoted is gone something is next due and per month thereafter My significant other has been with for years never a ticket or accident She is the who originally recruited me in fact I go running down the hall to tell her what has happened and to call them immediately to her rates lowered as she is now paying more for than I am for two She calls spends her minutes they not budge Every reason on earth why she has to pay more for less than I now do the best being that I qualify for a multiple discount that she does not you imagine that Because I present more of a risk by having two under full coverage I pay less overall than she does for less risk She next contacts the agent we have our homeowner's with and gets an auto quote really great at that Gets it all lined up and ready to pull the trigger and then makes the call the magic call the   You cancel my policy effective midnight tonight   call So sorry let me transfer you to our crisis situation specialist and here we go From something per month to it for full coverage on brand new plus RV on our camp trailer So how long would have charged us both such higher than necessary premiums when their pricing structure already existed to give us these prices I think we all know the answer to that Plus now after reading many of you other posters' stories I feel confident that a windstorm or rain shower or rare bird sighting in the near future take my status from A down to Q and I a letter in the mail soon making all of this moot I have already selected my next carrier and am standing by to switch But until then per month for my new I hope this helps anyone out there If you have been with for a long period of time and are considering changing I suggest following the steps we both did quotes from others read reviews on their quality of service etc make a choice and then make the call the magical call the   Yes you cancel my policy effective midnight tonight   call Worst that happen you call your new agent and say   Let's do this    
   file a claim unless you want to be treated like a liar and criminal stars for value because they are cheap but you what you pay for  
My was hit with hail twice in the recent storm in Oklahoma cheated me and paid me by combining two damages together and declaring my perfect total loss and then selling me back the for half of what they paid me I tried every means in but it seems they all know how to rip off people because they transferred me from adjuster to till I was exhausted and gave up I be filing a complaint with the commissioner if that goes anywhere Ha ha 
 The same thing happened to me Sept My rates went up by percent When I called them they they took off my good driver discount because of a minor accident my son was involved in February this year So I suggested we a separate policy for him since he was in college and hardly using the After an hour of questions answered his policy was established for And they quoted my wife and I a decent premium with good driver discount annual premiums This is what we used to pay for years before my son came aboard A while later I thought to check on my policy and I was I asked to speak to a supervisor and he raised it to His name was George && In an arrogant voice he he apply the good driver discount that the rep before had re established only an hour earlier till April I have been a loyal customer for years and never shopped around for better deals I feel humiliated and upset at for hiring such incompetent persons and with different quotes in phone conversation Rip offs  
 We are a small Paintless Dent repair company with over years of experience We travel across the world to fix hail damage on I have to say of all the companies we deal with is the worst They should not be in business and should be investigated by the State Department of This company of my customers we did not repair her and stole her money The funny thing about it is we released her and no payment and went off a trust customer decision Several times we have repaired and waited month to paid We did not hold this against our customer I went to speak to these adjusters in regards to this false accusation and they turned wheels and tried several times to tell me a different version They accused my customer of fraud as well We are a smaller company and treat our customers as normal human beings and not numbers We take pride in what we do This specific incident they wrote the estimate extremely low but we even them to come reinspect it So deciding not to inconvenience our customer we repaired at the lower price When approaching these two adjusters who did not use a light to inspect the they were very unprofessional and rude Even at point yelled at me We as a company have decided we need to make all vendors aware of how bad this company is When is the State Department of to step up to predators like this  
 In the last four years I have had two not at fault accidents where a driver backed into my in a parking lot causing minimal damage to my right headlight and where a driver rear ended me eighty miles per hour totaling my In both cases the other driver's company covered all of the costs After the second accident I was stunned to open my statement and read that my rate had gone up by FIFTY percent I asked a friend who worked for an company to look over my policy and tell me what had happened He that companies use the letters of the alphabet to determine rates had moved me from an A driver best rate all the way down to a Q driver When I called they explained that their underwriters had decided I was a risky driver despite the fact that I had been insured with for eight years had never claimed a penny and was supposedly still a   safe driver   discount The employee I talked to on the phone helpfully pointed out that I was still the safe driver discount as though that would make me feel better for paying fifty percent more for my I switched companies and never go back  
 I was hit from behind while sitting at a stoplight The impact was so strong that I struck the in front of me and they struck the in front of them The driver at fault is insured by company and has admitted to fault I have been by my physician and physical therapist that I require future medical care has me that THEY decide what medical help they pay for and as it stands now they are only willing to settle for in my pocket for pain and suffering and loss of quality of life I the representative that I intend to make a complaint with my state's Commissioner She care and refuses to settle for anymore  
 I was checking website looking for rate on adding a child to my account and like everywhere else I was expecting that clicking Cancel ends the quote NO not in Immediately their system creates a bill to be electronically transferred from my bank account I emailed and called them asking them about this illegal SLAMMING and why they were billing me for a quote Obviously they tried to justify their mistake telling me that since my child is still living with me I was responsible for his up to the age of unless he buys his own because sooner or later he be driving my My premium increased % This is not over yet I filed a complaint to the state  
 Worst Service Worst Rates I have been a loyal member for years I have never had a problem with them until I my recent bill in the mail and I find out that my   activity   on my account has caused my bill to go up to almost I call to ask what is on Apparently not at fault accidents cause me to lose a premium discount I questioned them as to how not at faults where you are found not at fault at all and had no control or ability to avoid cause you to pay more Especially when of them was never filed as a claim and I paid out of my own pocket because it was below deductible The first rep I talked to stated it is what it is and it be changed as my own fault Second rep was as belligerent I asked for a manager to call me back and unless they back to me I am switching carriers and quickly That is the largest pile of crap I have ever seen and be sure to review them this way everywhere I right on telling all those other drivers out there NOT to hit me when I am on the road as it causes my premium to go up when they are drunk or not paying attention and decide to hit my I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM  
 I'm tired of hearing   we are sorry we do anything about it   BS When they ask for payments they are fast When you need them takes forever for them to reply Unfair Claims take months of stress Act fast you retards And they make you debts that they even care It would be understandable if they would let you know they pay for a certain bill but why wait for months when the billing company turns it over to a credit bureau When you call them about it   we are sorry we do anything about it   Ohhh really nice of you Gonna sue your ** Well hospital bills are taken cared off after long months of waiting you are dead  
I have had similar problems with Enough is enough I am a Paralegal and know that we & should file a Class Action Lawsuit against Please Let us together & file a Class Action Lawsuit for we have years to file from the time of the accident You contact me or contact a lawyer in your state Let's stand up & fight together & we WIN TOGETHER I refuse to be bullied by & their useless staff 
 Back in February I was involved in an accident where a hydroplaned into me It was definitely not my fault probably the fault of the guy that was three up blocking the flow of traffic making an illegal left The damage to my was all cosmetic air bags did not even deploy I drove the home had my mechanic give it the eyeball and write an estimate before their adjuster to it I had to drive the to the adjuster which was weird but I complied They too held the   Hostage   from February to May They wanted the total the based on their mechanic's a repair shop with a really bad reputation in my neck of the woods based on their bill The difference between my mechanic and theirs was nearly triple mechanic duplicated labor costs in their estimate added work to a section of the with NO damage and was not even impacted paint the interior of a panel that is not even painted in original manufacture of the and the list goes on I asked to file an appeal and they mouthed off at me and claimed my mechanic was not licensed without even seeing the estimate or knowing which shop I used They tried to threaten me saying I was to kill myself or someone else driving the When I asked why the sudden change when they were insistent I drive the for over a week almost miles before they would even look at it The adjuster asked me to sign the title of the over to her and she would write a check claiming I had no other choice I looked closer at the valuation and when I saw they did price comparisons in state where the cost of living is much lower I pulled prices and the discrepancies were about Essentially they lied about the damages and lowered the value of the using a different market to try to total the I called the State Department of and they I had the right to file an appeal and I did so with corporate While this is all happening the claim adjuster is leaving threatening messages that she have my policy canceled and blackball me from having with any other carrier if I do not sign the title of the over to her corporate sent a supervisor out who was as much of a fast talker and refused to put anything in writing He admitted that features and condition of the was miscalculated and thought I would be happy with He refused to explain why they used market the value the refused to explain the bill padding by their mechanic refused to pay the lower amount I was asking for my mechanic's estimate minus deductible They also refused to acknowledge or explain why I would sign the title of my over to the claim adjuster The State Department of sent an investigator and they refused to respond to the state investigation In the meantime it had been over months and they had the held hostage and refused to release it so I could arrange for repairs Mind you even though I was involved in these negotiations the claim adjuster was still calling and harassing me to sign the title of the over to her multiple times a day I recorded a total of voice mails and over hang up missed calls on the phone while trying to work with corporate The claim adjuster wanted me to go to this rural out of state location to buy a new sight unseen to this dealer that would exchange a for me signing over the check to him She had no idea the make model mileage or any other information about the I called the dealership pretending to be a new    adjuster   and he offered me the same deal for referral fees on % of his total commission He he exchanges the check for the lowest clunker he has that sell on the lot I gave corporate a final written notice to either pay the claim at the lowest repair cost or pay the total loss based on the calculations in my state I had a licensed adjuster with company run the comparisons to verify my numbers and I was dead on I gave them week to release the before I notify the police they stole it and file a criminal complaint I the back The tow truck driver they use me that he drove the onto the flatbed and nothing was wrong with it He also that the claim adjuster and the body shop have a deal especially with older that have solid engines and were well maintained They strip it for parts and wind up making between K on the parts and scrap metal and each of them take a cut why she wanted the in her name would think would want the evidence their employee and body shop partner was scamming them to pay more expensive claims called in response to my letter and that I had to stop telling lies because I had   sour grapes   and that I should be happy I the opportunity to buy a newer I changed carriers the fixed and it runs like always Nothing was wrong expect the dented bumper and of the panels and light fixtures No leaks the frame was not bent The was not even knocked out of alignment The new carrier even saved me money on both my When I canceled GIECO the retaliation and threats began I first a letter from American Bankers out of Florida They claim I purchased a homeowners policy from them and I authorized them to automatically debit money from my bank account I call the number on the mystery letter because I never had through these people and I do not own a home I am a renter They had some automated call system where you not to a live person I call the Department of and the name and phone number of the corporate office in Florida who is responsible for all business in my state I call the contact and the woman refuses to answer any questions about the policy and who authorized it or any other information about that automatic debit and what account number they were provided I was concerned about ID theft at the time The woman was really nasty and me to hold on while she pulled the account number off the letter she put me back in that automated system When I called back I kept her voice mail The operator me the woman left instructions she did not want to take my call I bring the letter to my bank and we close the account I new ATM cards and the bank starts filing some report because the automatic debit letter was not written the way it should be under Federal banking laws because it did not identify the last digits of the account they threatened to use Two weeks later I start harassing calls from that they tried to charge my account and my card was no good and they if I did not give them within hours they were damaging my credit The was the same as the this American Bankers threatened to debit I check it out on line and they are affiliated somehow retaliated with the cancellation I placed on the auto by selling my information and claiming I bought a new policy for a home I do not even own Makes no sense to me but I reported it to the State Department of asking they help track down my signature or electronic entry authorizing the purchase of the policy The point is there be none started sending nasty emails because I did not renew my auto I sent an email back explaining exactly why I canceled and their lack of customer service and shady employees I them I did not trust them and I did not want involved in their company They started threatening by email to make me   uninsurable   falsely claiming I did not meet my obligations My current carrier was shocked when I asked about the email and I sent a copy to them They they would tell them there was no lapse in coverage as they started my new policy a month before cancellation and in fact owes me a refund for days coverage overlap letter of complaint to the State Department of I started harassing calls again today calling my cell phone AND my work phone about that mystery homeowners policy making more threats AND they had the nerve to send a   late payment   notice on a policy I never had As soon as I through that round of calls they start calling again threatening to call the police and tell them I was driving an uninsured unless I gave them a credit card number I them again I have a new carrier and they they had proof I was not covered through some state run program and I had to pay them or I would go to jail but once I supplied proof of they would reimburse any unused portion I   oh Really   and asked for that day credit they hung up on me I home and I have a PINK envelope notice from telling me they were damaging my credit for NON PAYMENT of Premiums and cancelling my policy Thankfully the new carrier policy and cards arrived at the same time today These people are a piece of work  
 The representative stated that ANY accident doubles my premium and what happened to me Earlier this April a cyclist crashed into my driver mirror while I was at a park picnic The cyclist was slightly bruised and left a note to call him for a repair Friendly fellow learned about the accident and doubled my premium within months from the accident even though the cyclist paid out of pocket I am leaving due to the unfair policies about reporting accidents that changed my tier status into   high risk    To my surprise of representatives suggested not ever reporting accidents I was shocked I am leaving ASAP A former customer reminded me that   psycho   rhymes with but that sounds extreme I am disappointed by the unethical and unfair practices of  
 I had full coverage including GLASS EXPRESS COVERAGE RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COMPREHENSIVE AND COLLISION OH AND ROADSIDE SERVICE My windshield was cracked driving down freeway I am covered under my policy with however they refuse to fix it stating I have a deductible However my policy states   the deductible is waived as long as I hold Comprehensive coverage    I replaced my windshield I am still complaining and fighting with  
 I have been bowling in the same Bowling alley for almost years and know the layout of the parking lot I was leaving Thursday night after bowling exiting through the middle exit lanes between the upper and lower designated parking spaces I approach the building to the side of the exit and a Saturn Vue comes flying down the exit lane beside the building away from the bowling alley and slams into my right front wheel The driver of the Vue was the boyfriend of and owner whom had After the police to show up as the driver would not give me any of his personal information which they could not file a report I argued with the claims rep over the phone many times and finally received a letter stating they are not paying for my damages Even went as far to say I was cutting through parking spaces and in fact hit the Sue Anyone with a brain to see there is no way I could hit the Vue as my damage was on the right front side I even supplied witnesses whom were passing by and noticed the accident in the parking lot is a horrible company and I would never recommend anyone to be covered by them for any type of My deductible was the total cost to repair my over and a charge for a day rental I have all the paperwork from this accident and would like to recoup the total cost to repair my the deductible and the rent a  
  'totaled out' my SUV when there was no need for this SUV had some front end damage but SUV could have been repaired body shop was paid by to have the there for week and increased the estimate And I had to pay a deductible Accident was not my fault the truck in front of me clipped my front end Total repair bill was and I was driving miles per hour Air bag did not deploy My monthly payment was scheduled for the th and it was made cancelled my policy after years and to reinstate it they wanted months paid in full I refused and went to Nationwide Beware of  
 I spent the required time to supply all information online to from After completing the application process given a number to call with a ref number A polite young lady answers after a short wait She tells me she has a short battery of questions to ask me to   make sure   offering me the best quote My ears go up a little after hearing this due to the fact that already been offered a quote of for months which I was quite happy with After asking me the same questions as those asked online to which I inquired as to why she again me it was to make sure they were offering me the best rate She came back with a rate that was higher than the quote already given me All my answers were honest only had violation in the last years and that is all This is absurd That little lizard makes the perfect spokesperson  
 I was recently involved in a hit and run accident by policy holder I was stopped at a red light and was rear ended I out of my to check for damage and I informed the other driver that I was calling the police for an accident report and that is when she took off Luckily I her plate number I a police report sent it over to and when I went to my fixed I was my claim was denied I called up and asked why it was denied and I was that they spoke to the other driver and the other driver that there was no contact with my yet I out and checked for damage anyway and her it was ok to go Why would I out of my at a red light check for damage and have words with driver if   no one   hit my I that there was a red light camera at the scene of the accident and they me that they the red light camera unless someone was seriously injured Then I was that I would have to wait until the other driver was arrested for the hit and run before they did anything about it Finally when the police informed me that the other driver was arrested I called to let them know that they could confirmation with the police station that the other driver was arrested Three weeks has gone by and I did not receive a call back from so I decided to call them I was by the claims rep who was handling my case that she called the number that I gave her and she already had it on file because she repeated it back to me She has called that police station once before that no had answered the phone when she called LIE It is a police station It is open hours days a week including holidays So I her that was an unacceptable answer and to call back and please call me when she gets through This accident happened April th and it is now July th and nothing is resolved I am guessing they are giving me a hard time because they want me to lay out a deductible for the repairs so less that they have to pay out Not to happen I was rear ended while stopped at a light This is clearly a third party claim and should be handled as such Shame on you What am I paying you every month for Nothing  
I called ahead of time to make changes in my account I was that everything was documented and handled I received an email weeks later telling by next week I would have no When I called to see what was the problem the changes I made were never documented as they say and my policy would no longer be valid in a week They also proceed to tell me there was nothing they could do When they are taking your money they have no problem being nice and helpful but when they mess up and the customer is screwed then nothing they do I have never heard of such a thing Where is the customer service They are liars and cheats 
 I am handicapped suffering from a partial knee replacement holding a disabled card as well as a handicapped license plate I also suffered a TIA stroke several months ago and present handling of my claim is not doing my health any good I rely on my Acura TSX for mobility on a daily basis On June while driving on the highway on my way to Las Vegas my hit a large piece of a tire possibly a piece that came off a recapped truck tire that was laying on the middle of the highway That same evening at approximately I contacted in order to file a claim and was informed by of the associates that I should not worry as the accident should be covered by the above policy I was also during that conversation that I should take my into a body shop rent a for the full duration of the repair and that the rental costs would be covered by That conversation was recorded inter alia for quality assurance I followed up on associate's instructions and soon after delivered the to the body shop as well as rented a rental On about July an auto damage adjuster on behalf was sent to the body shop inspected the and the damage evaluated it and presented and myself with a complete report among others as to the extent and costs of repairing the damages to the To my regret since July the outstanding service which personnel promises during each phone conversation I hold with them is not being delivered Not only that I am not any service personnel are communicating to me contradictory information as to when my be repaired and ready as well as to the extent of the coverage of my policy in particular the rental coverage In addition several messages I left on personnel's voicemail boxes and at this point I prefer not to name people were ignored and left unanswered Apparently at some point in time decided to reinspect the via an accident reconstruction specialist following that decision and despite a promises by personnel that a particular inspection should take place within approximately hours the actual inspection was delayed by several more days and its results are yet to be delivered to and me nor there was any initiative on part or anyone on their behalf to contact me and or to put that saga to a finish We are nearing a month's period since the original accident and is not any closer to resolving my claim as than it was approximately a month ago The way has handled my claim thus far is substandard and is well beyond any reasonable time for such claim I urge to act immediately repair my and bear all costs for rental with no further delays in order to minimize damages I must emphasize again that I am disabled I need my and is trying to wear me out I was also informed by a few people that the   special reconstruction investigation   is a common practice at thus delaying settling claims  
   make this short and sweet has America hoodwinked They sponsor major sporting events and most unknowingly would think they are a good company They spend gazillions on advertising for name recognition and boy does it work I had a good friend that worked for in CS and he had to quit because they put people on hold passed phone between multiple people and basically wore the caller down They continue to disappoint their customers but luckily they have the gecko to bring in new unsuspecting ones Thanks  
 denied my claim simply because they were unable to in touch with their customer 
 Tampa Florida is a super horrible company I had an accident on Took them almost weeks to tell us they were to complete the repairs on the days later totaled has not communicated with me or my spouse on this matter Wanted to give us for our Um no That was worth almost k I not accept half the value I had to call and them to release my personal belongings from the which the claims adjuster was calling about days later after I took care of it myself to come and our things from an IMPOUND LOT HA HA clear they have NO IDEA what is really on So now I sit almost two months later with no more information than I had at the week marker Their customer service manager even complete a sentence without the words    UMM   Or   HUMM   Pretty sad when you are the customer service manager for your company and you suck at your job I never use for my again  
I called this rip off company about adding my son to my policy just a quote and now they added him to my policy and be charging me dollars more every months I them that I want him on my policy and to take him off I explained to them that he does not live with me and does not drive my but they me that it is their policy to insure him since he has a valid driver's license They me that the only way I him off my policy is to show proof that he is insured somewhere else He his license and even have a do They care 
 I have been a customer for year and half I six months and then switched it to Farmers and again re switched it to I have my full with and I thought it is the good with a little bit cheaper price After I had an accident and needed they made me crazy They sent an adjuster and spent about in my Corolla which is more than half of my price Also the adjuster answered his phone rarely Sometimes we would call the number to complain of the situation and then he called back quickly The worst part is because the wanted to spend less on our claim they let the body shop use original part and the body shop is supposed to use aftermarket part instead of the original part However those parts have warranty with Anyway I had the accident about eight or nine months ago and the only reason that written this review is because still to the Mike Calvert Toyota for my accident and the body shop guy in Mike Calvert Toyota never answers me correctly The only reason is if the adjuster in did his job correctly for sure my was totaled and really upset about it GO WITH You may spend less but when you need them THEY ARE NOT HELPFUL  
 My wife was driving out of our driveway and hit my Well thinks that is two separate accidents and we should pay two deductibles What a mistake to change from Travelers to these bozos They have their designated repair shop which I have no problems with but they have negotiated the rates down to ridiculous amounts so the repair shop wants to the job done for as little as possible The quality of the repairs is quite poor We are here for months and then off to some other insurer  
 On June I was rear ended by a insured on the Belt Pkwy admitted full responsibility for their insured It took over a week before came to the collision shop to examine my The adjuster that was assigned by was insinuating the collision shop and myself were trying to commit fraud The adjuster would not approve the proper materials to indemnify my automobile My is a Nissan Altima with miles never been in an accident I feel that if they treated me like a criminal I see how treats their customers After the experience I had and with all the complaints from customers the sweetness of their so called cheap price is very soured with the workings of is supposed to give you peace of mind needs to a piece of the mind from the various States Departments  
 I was paying around for and drivers one a teenager I added a new jeep and took off an old van I still paid around I bought an year old jeep and for liability was quoted with the reason that every is different  
 After reading all of these posts and being in the middle of the claims process myself and seeing the future of how this is to play out I am finding myself wondering Is there anything that be done Are there any class action suits that be taken  
 In June of this year I was checking online for new quotes After finding a few I made a few calls to some more information on them I called and their representative me thank you for my interest on my quote and she would be happy to help me BUT she then proceeded to tell me I owe them MONEY on a delinquent account I am floored because I have never used She then went on about that The account is from and belonged to my now ex husband We were married in and then divorced shortly after I have my own carrier and was never on my husband’s I the lady She requires on their contract that if a single person marries the spouse IS automatically added without the consent of the spouse Talk about that being crooked My carrier had us come in to sign papers before I could put my spouse on my policy and he had to sign off to remove him during our divorce they had been sending collection bills every month to my address for years I have never gotten piece of paper from them I asked to email a copy of this so called delinquent policy times I still have not received anything on it DON’T USE  
 I have with in liability I met an accident snow skid and no hurt and there was no property damage The only thing damaged was my I called expecting some help they took all the information and raised my premium and did not help me a penny I was paying extra money for nothing I job transfers to WI and I went with American Family They not only gave me very good prices but they also helped me when my new Toyota Camry was involved in hit and run American Family repaired my back to normal and did not charge anything So I strongly recommend everyone NOT to go with Before to them take quotes from other companies NOT satisfied with They cheated me and took my money without helping me  
 From a recent phone conversation with sales and rep at the number posted on their website concerning business none of the representatives would offer help on general inquiries and coverages unless you were already an existing customer with them “You have to already have coverage with us in order for us to help you ” If service was friendly to start I would have considered switching an existing to theirs Bad first impression = lost customer  
 My hit on the road parking over the night The next morning when I figured it out I found a note on my window It was the claim number and phone number So I called gave that claim number to and they gave me a rental Apparently they stopped paying that rental but did not notify me immediately The estimation of damage was pretty much like my deductible so it does not make sense to fix it under my own But that rental should not be my responsibility So it looks like I end up paying to the rental and my not fixed all scratched bumper I should say even if Progressive is a little expensive at least they cover their full covered customers  
 I thought I would shop for cheaper What I want was a cheaper coverage When talking to a agent on the phone I read directly off my other policy stating what coverage that I wanted I clearly stated I want full coverage When I received my policy it showed all the same coverages that my policy showed Then months later my son totals my truck I call and they say “Sorry you have full coverage ” What Something make sense I clearly stated full coverage and the policies read the same Very disappointed and looking for more info and a lawyer  
 I had an accident back in fixed my truck Supposed to be if something went wrong I could bring the truck back day I went to drive my truck The truck was hard to turn I take the truck back They tell me it was the sterling hose that was making the sound when you turn They claim they fixed the problem I the truck back About three days the noise starts back As I try to turn around the truck the steering would not straighten up and I hit a tree They tell me I to pay again The truck did the same thing They claim they took it to a dealer to put it on a machine And I have to pay for it First they claim there was nothing wrong with the truck Now they the dealer found something wrong but cannot tell when the part was messed up Now I have not heard a word from them I ask for the CEO of the company and they not give it to me I am a disabled veteran and I the runaround from this I need a lawyer to help me  
 Let's make it plain company before something happens and you need to file a claim My truck was totaled in an accident and undervalued it at less than its Blue Book price leaving me with the loan not paid off on it On top of that I was stonewalled and I was a liar stupid know what I was talking about they it nicely of course as they patted themselves on the back about THEIR knowledge When I caught them in a flat out lie to my face they showed they were textbook sociopaths by continuing their line of BS to me without missing a beat Do NOT go with this company unless you like screwed  
 I was in an accident back on It is now over a month later and I still have my back This is due to lack of William ** the adjuster for doing his job correctly My truck was in a bad accident where the rear of the truck was damaged badly In my personal opinion the truck should have been totaled I was supposed to my truck back this past Monday and received a call from the body shop that the rear axle of the truck is no good They submitted a request for a new rear axle a week ago and heard anything back from I am now without a rental because of cap on a rental agreement I have no way to work and no and this is fault Their adjuster left the rear axle off the original estimate and now I am without a prolonging my being repaired  
 My son was in the store parking lot in the middle aisle completely stopped waiting for pedestrians to move so he could pull in the space in front of him on the passenger's side when an old man hit him in the rear bumper on the driver's side and backed into him and claimed my son hit him Then the man pulled back in his spot and claimed my son hit him A woman came over asking what happened The man her his side so she she'll be his witness We a letter saying they believed the old man and my son failed to look in the mirror while backing up Duh he was sitting still not backing up What kind of people do they have working here They sure care about their clients of years no accidents This is ** They care about you  
 I called on Wednesday to report an accident I a claim number and asked when I could my fixed since my lease is up first of July and I have a trip to be away from Miami for week starting next Wednesday I have no to take my for me I was initially by claim agent Amanda ** that because of the problems in Oklahoma the company was shorthanded I am a doctor I work long days and I have a BIG TIME CONSTRAINT Amanda was able to me an appointment in Hialeah on Friday tomorrow at AM I it was not convenient but I took it and then changed my patients for tomorrow When I looked at my computer this morning the service was set up for Doral today at PM which I had no knowledge about and I was booked with patients I very upset and spent minutes trying to rectify the situation only to find out there was no appointment for me Friday morning I then asked to speak with a supervisor Tammy ** Her people skills were less than desirable and she did not BELIEVE ME but Amanda Interestingly I had the Hialeah address where would I have gotten that She handled the situation poor at best I did not feel at any time that was on my side but covering their mistake It is hard for me to conceive that I cannot an appointment for days and that the location is so far away I also cannot comprehend that given that your company made THE MISTAKE that there be any other options I am not trusting of that they have my best interests in mind I am considering changing company This is a horrible way to treat a customer  
 You never in touch with the adjuster for the claim to ask simple questions And once you actually someone on the line NOT AN AUTOMATED PERSON they inform you that they do not work on that team and cannot help My problem is how do you know you help me if you know what my question is I do not recommend this company to my worst enemy Companies that are excellent when giving you the policy and taking your money but when it hits the fan TERRIBLE voice mails and transfers Do not waste your time or money  
 Not only has let me down they have flattened me My accident occurred on I was hit on the passenger's side resulting in in damages questionable I was treated in the ambulance and my was towed The police bother taking a statement from me Instead they waved me away stating that   it was okay they had the information   The offending party to drive his truck away from the accident with a broken light The police report states that I was % at fault How could they know this if they never took a statement from me Even the way both were positioned shows the police report to be incorrect I also have witnesses that agree that this guy tried to beat the light thus hitting me as I made my left turn Oh by the way he was in the turning lane but was straight This is of significance because had he been in the proper lane he would have stopped as there was a in front of him that stopped for the light And did I mention that the representative for the other party Ernesto smugly stated how   we both had the same light so it matter which lane he was in   My mouth is still on the floor from that statement So received the police report on May th and stated that within business days someone would come out to assess for damages A FULL ELEVEN days later the adjuster shows up So to fix the to pay for storage Total damage to me and the loss of my And how much pay this loyal never late in paying customer>> What I say The commercials that state settles claims quickly is the biggest load of ** I have ever experienced My personal experience with It may not matter to you but you have lost a loyal customer for LIFE  
 I rented a from Budget We were driving on Route in Louisiana during a rainstorm and a young man hit me in the rear He admitted he was too fast There was damage to the rental took days to call me Then they since my fiancee used his credit card for the rental they could not cover the damages I used my on the rental and I was driving I am so angry The young man's information was sent to I need help here should not away with this I have had them for about two years and never had an accident  
 Only telling the truth here If you have and hit your own screwed They pay for it a lovely CLAUSE they have in their policy Thanks I appreciate that Anyway hit my with my husband's which is not even covered by and they pay for it So I them refund my payment from today and I elsewhere I want my fixed his so I have to hear his crap So I pay cash for it and find with company  
 They cancelled my policy without my knowledge I drove around for three months without and was paying premiums every month Now I a decent policy because listed as not having  
Normal coverage Nothing fancy Terrible I paid for six months in advance but once I moved they wanted over twice as much more for the exact same coverage Needless to say I switched insurances as terrible They not work with you and do not care to keep your business Do not use this company ever They suck big time 
 My husband had to swerve to avoid accident causing him to total his truck We have full coverage on all our does not want to give us any more than wholesale for the truck I had two banking institutions blue book the truck They both was not offering the full amount we were entitled too Also I had two dealers tell me is the worse to deal with They put all these ads on tv how their rates are lower than anyone else now I know why They want to payout on a total wreck had emails sent to me and since when does someone text instead of making a phone call Also sure they increase my ins rate after this is settled If it ever gets settled It has been almost two weeks and we are still arguing with them  
 Never had a claim with THEM but because of a claim with they wanted a LOT more suddenly I like them at all for that reason Coverage of is pretty much the same as coverage of another it usually boils down to rates and how nasty they be if you ever   dare   to expect them to pay but smiles all the way as they want YOU to pay them I used them for years maybe + and never made a claim then used for a few years and had a small claim about then when I bought a new I inquired with them to back on their policy and suddenly I was being treated horribly I was a pariah because I had DARED to need a claim even though it with them Great if you never need them terrible if you ever do But then again I guess they are ALL pretty much the same The suits from all these companies together on a monthly basis to make themselves all the same so what is   called   competition is nothing of the sort when they are ALL THE SAME just different names  
 An imbecile swerved to skip a water puddle on a rainy day and ended up denting our on the passenger's side It turns out this imbecile happens to have as do we After about month of giving us the run around uploading police reports and other troubles we received some ridiculous and impersonal letter stating   Our investigation reveals that our insured STATES ** came into her lane and struck her    Let me point out that a man was driving the that struck us and apparently we go by what customers   state    Now this is not even about the damage caused to the as it was minimal This is about the principle and lack of respect that has for their own customers After finally in touch with of their employees and discussing the whole matter for what seemed like an eternal amount of minutes the representative come up with something to assuage my anger worked in retail and customer service for over years now so actually aware of what should be on between a rep and an angry customer This buffoon who was speaking to me had the audacity to tell me that    is in business like everyone else   therefore they cannot go around granting claims to whoever desires one What I to merit such a loathsome response I know What I do know however is that I am currently changing my company since they know how to help perfectly paying customers If they care about their business then why should I  
 When I was a brand new driver I started with because they were inexpensive It was seemingly all right until I into an   accident   note I have never had before and had after as of yet and they instantly accepted fault without even sending a claims adjuster out not even to listen to my given circumstance They failed to acknowledge the fact that I had my parked and was attempting to out of my when a man in a business van clipped my door off By default they claimed instantly that it was my fault by   failing to control   my because I released my hand from the door and it creaked open slightly not significantly at all another note I was driving an older in which the door weighed a significant amount Even after hearing the other driver's statements and the fact that he   had not even seen my car   they claimed it was my fault and would not allow me to petition it Personally I go to again and I admonish others from doing so as this was a very disgruntling and traumatic experience for me coming so close to being hit personally not to mention the lack of service on their part in helping me at all  
  sent me a letter saying they do not want to renew me due to too many incidents This be so bad if the incidents were true The tickets in years is true a seat belt disobey traffic device and something called NOC chargeable it was 'unsafe start originally' squealed tires after a seat belt ticket Here's the lie accidents years no accidents I something once on the phone when buying about backing into something and that person called Claims after me and I her or him that I did back into something I and neither did who I called know what the other was He someone hit me in the rear I once in jabbering I almost hit in the rear When on the phone with them do not talk about anything they ask you In that way my fault for talking too much to the point of being misunderstood at best and an overzealous customer service liar at worst That or stupid with no comprehensive skills   The industry is the only multi billion dollar industry with absolutely no federal regulations   but a multitude of lobbyists They do whatever they want Oh the real reason they mention for some reason is or three comp claims a hail storm and dog chewed through the seat belts twice and they me it was covered I know and report it These two were before I switched to for a better rate which went up every months  
 We switched companies to save money which would've been great if nothing happened My was perfect until Sat Apr th There was a flood which I was stuck in On Mon Apr th I realized the check engine light was on I called to it towed On Tue Apr th their towing company finally arrived to tow my to the wrong dealership Nissan not the I wanted Toyota but they to keep it there anyway since their flood specialist is there On Thurs May nd I finally heard from adjuster flood specialist Ricky ** who the is perfectly fine Next week Wed May th since the was fine I drove it and it stopped in the middle of the highway I had to it towed to Nissan They they looked at it last time and see anything and that there was nothing they could do I towed it to Toyota Within hours they there was a hole in my radiator On Thurs May th Ricky ** not due to flood even though I never had any problem until the flood so it be covered send adjuster Friday or Monday I called Tues May th and no adjuster was notified so I had to remind them again On Wednesday adjuster came and hole in radiator was caused by unknown causes and would not be covered In short wasted my time put me in danger by saying my is okay made me overheat my engine so instead of a radiator I need to replace engine as well nothing was wrong with it and refused to acknowledge my was damaged by flood even though it happened right after the flood I had Liberty Mutual before and when I was in an accident they were hassle free and I have to jump through any hoops So unless you live in a place with no floods no vandalizers no snow then you save money on the month to month fee Otherwise expect to save money  
 I have been a loyal customer since and was a customer throughout the 's recently my daughter was in an accident where the other person was cited for making an illegal lane change Both parties are insured with Our adjuster has done nothing but work against us She has been very defensive and argumentative It has been over a month now and my daughter remains without a I feel we are being penalized for both involved having as their carrier My son was in an accident when we had Allstate and all fees and deductibles were waived due to both being insured with Allstate What a difference in customer service

 Can anyone please help My parents were rear ended on When the behind them ran into them they were pushed into the in front of them We have been contacting the person's company since and have yet to speak to the assigned adjuster My parents do not speak English very well so I have taken the brunt of the aggravation with the company I have called every day except on the weekends for almost a month now and still have not spoken to the adjuster after leaving several messages I have spoken to many other people who tell me the same thing   You have to speak to the adjuster assigned to the claim    I in return explain that I have left several messages for the adjuster and she is not calling back I was given her supervisor's name and number and on two separate occasions that an email would be sent to him and he would be calling me back within hours still no response I have called and left the supervisor messages to no avail I am beyond frustrated Did I mention that my parents were injured in the accident and are dealing with that as well I am at my wits' end as I am a single mom a full time nurse a full time student and apparently now a full time case manager I need some guidance I have never used the phone as much as I have this last month

 So I live in a state where required to pay a full year's premium upfront at closing when buying a house Then every month I pay premiums ahead of time into an escrow account Every year is supposed to contact my mortgage servicer for payment of the next year's premiums for which already paid These clowns somehow had the wrong loan number on my policy So when they contacted the servicer for payment they paid This mistake on their end caused my policy to be cancelled When I questioned them on how something could've possibly happened they had no clue If they cannot be depended on for something so mundane then I have no choice but to move both my homeowners and policy to a competitor Ridiculous

 Andrew ** of never investigated compared or analyzed accusations being made He ignored policy holders for months and then that they are fault because someone so He never asked the other side for anything and would rather pick on their own policy holder As a result of his faulty actions we are in the middle of a possible lawsuit by the other driver thanks to Andrew When we found out about important evidence from city affiliated sources that proves that the police report made at the scene Andrew implied angrily by sending us a letter saying bother him and that he care for details and to try the California commission We did already and Andrew still refused to change his ways

 My old policy with was expiring I began new quotes from and other companies for new My year old daughter was now to be added to our policy since she now has her driver's license We had recently added her to the policy We changed companies due to a better quote from Progressive Last week I received a letter from collection department saying we owe them for coverage through February We had paid for our policy that started August and then paid the additional charges for when we added our daughter's I have called and asked why we were being charged They it was because they added my daughter to our policy when I was requesting a new quote They put her on our policy without telling us or telling us that we would owe them money The first time I found out about being charged is from this letter weeks after we ended our policy with I have made two phone calls to and nowhere with them I have asked for a manager to call me back and they have yet to call me back I should not have to pay them the  
  ** customer service Three weeks ago I changed my auto policy March or probably I talked to the service department but remember the name who I spoke to I of my friends met a hit and run accident and the company fully cover so I want to know what kind of policy I have related to hit and run accident in case it happens to me And she comprehensive and then I changed that from from deductible Last Friday March I found a dent on my passenger side front door I called the service department again to claim accident The person who I spoke to was Runnie She it belongs to collision policy What she me match what the other person to me last time She someone is to call me on Monday and investigate this case Monday came and no call On Tuesday I called again and talked to Jill ** who recorded what happened She Holly ** call me after a couple of days Today Thurs I received a call from Holly and she I still need to pay deductible for it I asked   You guys always this call maybe monitored or recorded Any evidence of that call    She they have any evidence so this claim belongs to customer's fault So I have to accept this and then I quit your service You suck  
 I tried to pay my boyfriend's SR payment The website to call so I did I was then advised that they sure of his marital status so they canceled it I very upset and requested a supervisor My boyfriend on the line and asked the supervisor why he hadn't received any cancellation notice email or calls Dustin supervisor they did send out a letter on the th of the previous month We never it Then Dustin hung up on him Now even madder I called back I was by supervisor that although we have paperless billing the letter is only mailed out and is not followed up with emails or calls She also me it had come back to them with   Not at this address on it    I know they are lying She then me he could start policy with them it had higher rates than the last and he had to pay the SR filing fee again Also last month he brought it to their attention that they had his coverage higher than they were supposed to and that he wanted it lowered to the bare minimum Then all of a sudden canceled Needless to say his license is now in danger of being suspended unless we through someone else for him Here's an update He has through Esurance now and they are not only way cheaper but also his marital status had nothing to do with SR

  placed my cell phone in an automatic collection calling machine and called me every day to collect what be due in   X   days   X    days   X    days so on till day before the payment is actually required After that payment was done they start series of calls from that day   Y   counting down every day till day before collecting I think they do this to force me to enroll in the automatic credit card payment They also collect daily by email and weekly by regular mail is paid in advance so actually the amount is not due Their excuse is that by state law they must advise that policy be cancelled but the law doesn’t say they advise every day all days is enough they actually enforce collection efforts for something I don’t owe but owe as an anticipated payment for the next month What does consumer protection has to say about this collections policy  
 I had an accident so I took my to the repair shop It was in the same location as the office and the Enterprise Rental the representative and the Enterprise Rental representative share the same office The representative and the enterprise representative actually are side by side at their counter When you bring your they give you the keys from the Murphy repair shop at the same facility However knowingly does not authorize the days required for the repair thinking that a senior not even notice and not need to pay for all the days I was not there was not a proper authorization for a rental and did not know until I was charged by Enterprise Rental until I saw using my online view and therefore noticed right away Enterprise side by side with it was my fault and it had nothing to do with them does this on purpose to rip off seniors and others by not paying what the policy covers This is the second time did this same thing to me This is their tactic in Florida apparently to rip off the people who pay for so that does not pay since you may not notice They’re a bunch of crooks and thieves  
 I have on multiple since years without a single claim Recently I had a failed water pump on my Toyota SUV which required urgent attention I reasonable quotes and took it to the nearest dealer for repair and then called since I had Mechanical Breakdown under which it was covered The agent me he would talk to the repair shop and back back saying they would reimburse only on top of my deductible for repairs which cost ~ They blamed me for not prior authorization and the repair shop was unwilling to negotiate down to their parts labor prices I wasted over an hour talking with and the repair shop spent an equal amount of time on the phone with no compromise I regret and not reading the fine print  
  issued a new auto policy for me on August for At the time the policy was issued we had several discussions and review of my secondary driver my year old daughter The policy was supposed to have been written up in consideration of both of us drivers including the fact that she is under and away at school Suddenly is now telling me after having already increased my policy amount to in February that now they are to charge me an additional I feel strongly that they performed a bait and switch as it is difficult to move companies I explained that if we could not do better than my previous company and the price was to be the same anyway I would prefer to stay with my other carrier It does not seem fair that companies make this kind of a shift with no cause We have had no claims and nothing has happened to warrant any change They are telling me that my daughter was included on the policy back in August but that I was not being charged I do not see how that is possible when we had such extensive discussions about my daughter and the representative at the time Shannon who assured me that this would be my policy rate and that it factored in consideration of my daughter being under age I believe should honor its rate with me and its end of the business deal It is not right that companies have people over a barrel with regard to pricing and increasing policy rate without cause  
 I am beyond my wit’s end with this policy and the relationship or lack thereof between Liberty Mutual and whom I have combined home and auto policies for the sole purpose of marketed discounts promised but never given the first few years due to system limitations words Finally after years I was given my marketed promised discount on home policy and further promised that I would not have to police the discount forward but it would systematically be applied forward year and many hours of endless pointless conversations with both and Liberty have elevated my frustration to heath conditions of elevated blood pressure and stress as my renewal due May shows removed multi policy discount auto and renovated home discounts and increased my premium from to a net increase of with no apparent plausible or justifiable explanation or reason I have owned my home for years and have never filed a claim for and carry an additional rider policy with Inland Marine Policy #** and have never had a claim or increase in premiums All of my policy documents are explicitly signed and agreed by Liberty Mutual Yet directed to for account maintenance and they have no clear product account knowledge or ability or unwilling to fulfill advertised marketed promised discounts which lead to undoubtedly cancellation of this and every policy respectively Further I was by both Matt Brett and his supervisor Donna at that further elevation of my concerns would be futile And although my documents are signed by David M Long President Stephen ** Authorized Representative and Dexter ** Secretary they insisted they did not know who these people were or how to email or contact them and no point in discussing this with anyone further and that they have the final word And no matter what I would not receive my promised discounts or any other qualified discounts unless discontinued and ended this policy and start a new which may or may not be lower than the renewal premium of not the smartest person however I do know that the federal government along with the Kentucky Department of along with the Consumer Protection Division and the KY State Commissioner would all be interested in knowing who at they should to know  
I had a accident on Feb th I was hit and is still giving me the runaround about repairing my I have exchanged several emails & a couple of phones They are stating they have not been able to reach the policy holder

 I was involved in an accident two weeks ago with two other The main person at fault has as their company I feel bad for her I was at a stoplight waiting for the green light when a Saturn began taking a left into the parking lot I was waiting to exit Needless to say the coast wasn’t clear and she T boned by a Cadillac The force of the collision sent both spinning into me sitting at the stoplight The Saturn taking the left is at fault according to the police and State Law She has and is screwed They actually sold her a policy that has a maximum of in liability My damage was fairly minimal compared to the Cadillac and her it was estimated at over not including my rental for weeks So apparently I have to pay for my rental because her won’t pay for it and then sue her to that money back Wow I’m glad I don’t have I can’t imagine being hung out to dry by an company I’m not sure what’s to happen with that Cadillac I’m glad I my claim in before they did because they are probably being advised that they have to sue her because is tapped for the K So as a customer she gets sold a cheap ass policy by her agent then gets in an accident Her gets totaled her policy only covers most of the damage to she gets sued by that me for their rental amount and sued by the other for their damage lots of and their rental costs Yowza I’m glad I don’t have She was left high and dry and sued twice  
 I was only days late in paying my renewal premium and they cancelled my policy and report to DMV and have me pay fine They use this way to punish their customers who inadvertently skipped a payment Their customer support crew has difficulty to distinguish cases between late payment and intentional lapse of coverage and always classify their victims as some   different class of drivers   who deserve higher premium They are simply apathetic and rude  
 I have on my truck The agent due to the age of my truck ten years old that it was not worth collision My truck was parked out front of my apartment and was struck by Patricia ** Patricia admitted hitting my truck I have a witness who saw Patricia hit my truck I have a police report stating Patricia hit my yet they do not have to pay for my truck because Patricia swerved from not hitting so therefore it was not her fault for running into my truck What Worst company ever to any help from  
 I have been with for over years Me my wife and my four son's are all on policy We never had any accidents Myself and son had speeding tickets Me over years ago and my son almost years ago it have to pay out a penny for all the years I was with them Recently I know how life happens but we missed a payment and cancelled our policy Not thinking it was a big deal I called them as soon as we realized our policy was cancelled I gave the representative my policy number her we forgot to make a payment and we needed to re do our policy She put me on hold for a matter of about seconds came back on the line and that they were not able to insure me She that I meet the criteria I was with them for over years and now I meet the criteria I asked her why and what specifically was the reason all she kept saying was that we meet the criteria So I guess I should thank because now I went to Progressive Flo and the same policy coverage for about less per month than kiss my shiny hiney Me and my family and everyone I know are switching away from Do yourself a favor and look at rid of before they rid of you  
 They screw people out of the money they owe them They collect collect and collect Then when it’s time for them to do their job they give me the runaround for over a year and didn’t even pay me the they owed me They decided finally to send me a check for What the hell is the point of paying a month or however much people pay only to back not even half of that when you need it is a scam especially low cut rate such as They are terrible people with an even worse business practice  
My was stolen The bottom line is that I be without a for more than two months Nobody in is willing to help 
 In July my new Subaru Legacy which was covered by a full tort fully stacked policy sustained hail damage I contacted a appraiser took the to the shop for his examination and was advised that an on site independent dent pair service could   pop   the dents and would replace a few trim parts I scheduled the repairs to be made a few weeks later so that the parts which had to be ordered would be available and the could be repaired in day I arranged to have the use of a rental for that day which too was covered by a policy provision A couple of weeks later I returned the for repairs picked up the rental gave the rental agent my policy information and returned to pick up the the next day only to learn that the trim parts had not arrived and although the dents were repaired I would have to return for the trim to be applied I also learned that during the course of the dent repair process the technicians could not engage my ignition due to a glitch in my computer chipped key which required them to put my in neutral drift it into the garage to make the repairs then push it back into parking lot They admitted that they were concerned as to why the key was not working properly and fearing the battery had gone dead recharged it all without my knowledge or permission When I inspected my I noted the inside fuse panel had also been removed and was lying on the floor and that two dents were missed When I pointed this out I was by the technician that   he was only human    My had not been washed and was covered with a gritty dust from the dent removal process and smelled of cigarette smoke I was so disturbed I in my and left A month later still not hearing back about the ordered trim parts I called for an update and was the parts were not yet in This was a Subaru and when I called a nearby Subaru dealer I was they had the parts in stock They were readily available and know what the problem might be A week later I received a my credit card statement which reflected a withdrawal from the rental company charging me for a full amount for a day rental which was not only fully covered by my policy but also I only had the for day not I called the rental company and was they submitted the bill to multiple times but that had denied payment When I called they denied that anyone from the rental company had notified them even though the rental company had provided me documentation to the contrary I asked to   fix   the problem but a few weeks later nothing of the sort had occurred In fact in the following two days I received two calls from the rental company advising me that notified them I would be needing a rental and that I could pick it up at anytime Of course I did not need a rental I called claims representative and he me to ignore the rental company that they were confused I asked when I would be receiving reimbursement for my rental they would be cutting the check the next day Nine days later when I still had not received reimbursement for the rental I once again called the Claims representative assigned to the case again and was given the runaround again I was they needed the rental company's tax ID in order to cut the check which was suspect since has an ongoing relationship with this particular rental company Besides the tax ID if they have it could be obtained with a phone call I asked to speak to the Claims representative's boss and finally after weeks of runaround she had the check cut for the rental and mailed to me The next month I received a call from the parts department and was they finally the trim items in for my By that time I had had enough and them to keep their trim I then cancelled my fearing that if they had this much difficulty in handling a simple hail damage claim what could I expect if I was involved in an accident I had no confidence in Claims division  
 You might think this company is good but wait until you have a claim First do not tell them anything or they use it against you and ** you over Good luck talking to their an hour employees who rush your claim through then tag you at fault They are supposed to be the investigative authority but when you ask them what questions they asked the other driver they answer They put the blame on the easiest party Well with a few simple phone calls and I would use an attorney if need be I had their at fault decision removed because they even try And this girl named Ashley claimed it would never happen Well Ashley you were ** wrong I the customer had your CEO office fix a problem that you had no brains over You lost Buyer beware Keep an eye on their Claims dept because they lie to you on the phone like you believe This place has the worst service when it comes to making adjustments It is true they have cheap employees who do cheap work Good luck and goodbye  
 I have been helping a friend of mine with a claim for the past months Her son was killed as a passenger in a insured He was only and have life so she had to take out a loan to pay for his final expenses It has been months and she received a dime Every time I call she speak English very well I a voice mail When I do to talk to the   adjuster   she is rude and not helpful This poor woman wants to pay off this loan so she have a constant reminder of her son's death You think be wanting to help her in a situation like this The coverage on the policy is pretty crappy not unusual for Their customer service is terrible All their money goes to advertisement not to paying out claims Cheap is great until you need to use it Don’t buy this crap  
 I was driving my fiancee's truck down a hill after a snowstorm hit us the day before I tapped my brakes once the truck started to pick up speed on the road with snow and probably ice Once I tapped my brakes the truck instantly started to slide I tried to prevent her truck from hitting and hit a utility pole instead I injured but the front end of her truck was badly damaged The truck was still drivable and my house was around the corner so I backed her truck up from the pole and lost her front license plate from the accident I called and informed her of what happened She called and made a claim The adjuster informed her that there be an investigation behind this From what I was the investigation started on the th of January I did an interview with the investigator He asked a series of questions and I answered them under the tape recorder truthfully He investigated her Now the kicker is this He is trying to put the fault on her when she was not driving the He is demeaning her intimidating her and also patronizing her I find this unacceptable and unprofessional behavior from someone whose only job is to find any wrongdoing in the claim that was presented and there was none On January the same investigator called and asked me to see her truck because from the picture he tell what was what which was a lie as well He came to my house and asked for the keys to the truck which I gave him All he did was go to the truck ask me if I have driven it since the day of the accident and look at the mileage I replied that the truck has been right here since the day of the accident and not been touched and that was it He wanted me to explain again what happened to the truck I went a step further and showed him where the accident occurred Lo and behold there was the license plate further near the accident area He took a picture and asked me why I the license plate at the time of the accident I him I find it the snow was pretty thick at that time We back in his and he took me back to my house He to me that the accident the issue it was the date I asked him how come because what I him was the truth and it my fault I also blame that to mother nature because the weather conditions on that day was still bad Then he that again the issue is not the accident but the date but that matter because he's to this resolved today or tomorrow So after he left I called her up and her what happened Not long after I talked to her guess who called her saying something totally different from what he me The investigator So she talked to the investigator and called me back crying I called the guy back and asked what was on He that he new information that harm this claim I asked him   What is that Because I understand what the hell happened    He by her the the day before the accident is consider fraud I him some ** because if that was the case he would have denied it right there if he had evidence He he thinks it happened on a different date I asked him   Then are you calling me a liar    He no Then I   Why are you saying thing to me and saying something totally different to her Do you have proof of your claims    He that she called her old three times that day on the th of December I asked   What does that have to do with anything She was shopping for new for her with a low premium    He mad and hung up on me Before he hung up he   I'm still investigating    For one I was the in the accident She has nothing to do with anything and she let me use her that day Now she's the criminal ** is up with this guy They are nuts Something must be done on this case I would love to hear from a lawyer concerning this matter How this be fraud due to weather conditions They already raised the premium up and the issue with the truck has not been resolved at all  
 My was stolen in the early AM hours on and recovered the same day It was found burnt out The police officer that took my report me that my company was to give me a hard time because of the “unusual circumstances” of the theft I guess it’s not typical for to be stolen and burnt me my was “totaled” on At first treated me very well All calls were returned etc Then after days I asked when I could expect my claim to be closed and a check for a replacement claims my was worth This is when I was treated differently I was my claim was being turned over to investigator and I would need to give interview Long story short given three interviews to last with a court reporter and they are still “investigating” It be months they have been investigating given them everything they have asked for phone records etc It seems that because my claim is unusual they have the right to investigate indefinitely Since my was stolen by a thief and I knew nothing about it they could investigate forever and never find anything to deny my claim So how long do they have to pay or deny my claim I am currently trying to find an attorney that is familiar with this type of case has obviously been handling my claim in bad faith and I want them to pay I’m an average guy and without a for months which has been a hardship on my family  
 I have owned auto for the past years and have absolutely no accidents or speed tickets day after a road trip I noticed small chip on my windshield and I remember has free glass coverage So I called up and agent Brandy ** is on my case I have been back and forth on this simple claim for a couple of months already What happened was she kept calling my husband's phone number while ignoring my number after I reminded her about it I made arrangement for her to call me on a Friday which I was able to take off and I was waiting and waiting and afraid to leave my phone on that day Guess what She never called that Friday Whenever I called she never picked her phone so I always left a detailed message I am working full time and usually have meetings throughout the day so I cannot pick up calls at any random time But it is her job to answer customers' call What makes it worse is she asked me to call her back Of course when I called back she never picked up her phone I tried to place calls at intervals and hope there is a chance she pick it up That never happened I am so frustrated at I have been such a good driver for the past years and have been paying my annual premiums Now I ask a simple glass claim It turns out this claim almost drained my energy and this case still has not been resolved was a star in auto years ago but it is really downhill Customers beware Unhappy customer  
 On I was in a motor accident I was making a left turn in the proper turning lane when a minivan struck me on the right hand side attempting to make a left turn from a middle name In the laws of driving we know this is not allowed The man left the scene of the accident after I made verbal contact with him and him to pull over I was able to his plate number and make model and color of the I called the cops and a police accident report I also called and reported the incident the same day I added the pictures of my and cooperated as needed We found out that this oriental man also had The damages to my are over per the inspection by the service center The man that hit me left the scene and never called to put in a claim until after someone from the claims department called to question him two days later inspected the other party's and found that he had past damage to his minivan but there was no concrete evidence that he had hit my and now is denying the accident ever happened Now he is saying he never touched my I have the paint on my still to prove it and pictures wants to dismiss this case I am not having this They insure people who drive recklessly but people who follow rules always screwed Too many people away with this I do not have this money to fix out of my own pocket because someone follow the rules of driving hits people and leaves accident scenes obviously has nitwits working for them when investigating I need assistance with this As a reputable company like they should be covering all corners and re investigating this at least to give a shot This is unreal I thought they were supposed to be # in savings and customer service My opinion is changed and I am very upset that I have been a loyal customer to them for as long as I have  
 After years of being insured with and insuring two different I had never had an issue and was accident free I had never needed their services or ever filed a claim I was very pleased with the service and never had a need to even look for company This past year my first claim was filed with Like I I had a clean driving record for over years so I was not even familiar with how to file a claim I called and I have to say they made the whole process very simple Little did I know how long it would take Sad to say the claim was denied All in all has left me with over in debt After years of loyal service this is what I am left with The company prides itself in its advertisements about how much you save by switching What they mention is how much you lose while staying I afford the debt I am left with as I am a single dad with child But sure that means nothing to All they see is the they have collected from me over years and would hate to give any of it back to me nice to know that I have a company like this in my corner Every single person I come in contact with know not to insure with This company does not reward loyalty in any way even if you were accident free and issue free for over years In addition my claim took over months to receive a final decision with almost no contact from other than the certified letter saying my claim was denied For four months I waited But believe it or not I had confidence that my claim would be approved being that it was the only issue I have ever had in my driving history Boy was I wrong If I convince person not to insure with then I feel I have done my job Thank you for nothing but showing me how horrible an company be and how easily you ruin someone's life and throw them into debt  
  has the worst customer service that I know I was my fixed from because they were at fault I called to see if they schedule my appointment for the next day because I had to be at work They were like   No we work around people's work schedule   and they were sorry but they do that which I feel is ** because they were not even busy  
  Company is the most slimy false company I have ever had the displeasure to do business with of their employees I still know her name to this day falsely informed me of procedures that go along with cancelling an policy that ended up costing me over When I spoke to a supervisor and her the girl's name who fed me the wrong information she sarcastically   Yeah let me go ask her what really happened    She left me on hold for ten minutes and then came back on to predictably tell me   She says not what happened    How convenient for you and your multimillion dollar corporation that your employee is refusing to own up to her mistake When I contacted the BBB about the matter I was fed the same bologna by a rep from their executive office They are now demanding that I pay for their employee's mistake with my money I am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed with how I was treated and spoken to as a customer the worst company ever  
 So it is Saturday Dec nd days away from Christmas We decided to take a trip up north about hours where we live to go on a little ski trip On the way home my had mechanical problems and decided to break down I finally it to a local shop who were so helpful and willing to me home However my was still under warranty and the problems it was experiencing would've been covered under warranty if I could a hold of the warranty company which unfortunately I was not able to Long story short I decided to contact I figured I pay an arm and leg every month in my premiums surely something they do to help me home I was in tears explaining the situation to the representatives After about an hour on the phone they me they could not help me They me I insured with them because I have the mechanical coverage I asked them what that was and why I about it when I signed up with their company She me they only offer it to that are brand new or leased Really On top of that I pay a very high premium and every year my premium goes up When I asked why that was they me even though a safe driver with no tickets violations accidents claims etc it matter because based on the overall state inflation and based on the rate of incidences in the area So basically raising my premium because of other people's carelessness in driving so disappointed in and have already begun to look for new With the amount of money I pay to them every month in my premium I pay company the same if not more for better customer service and better coverage  
 I was given a quote that was to include my children driving the Then later that it was rated properly and the change was to over more a month Then when I complained they honored the rate but then the lady who corrected it came back and changed it in year without warning Her notes it was only a temporary change and that in year they would raise it The only problem was I did not know it Then when I tried to correct the problem I was treated terrible Everyone kept back to her comments Then I this guy who that I should try to rewrite the policy since I I was moving back to Ohio He thought he was helping me I then this guy who rewrote my policy to effective immediately even though I was not in Ohio yet He he had to change my policy immediately or he could cancel my policy This was the Macon GA office  
 I was calling for a quote for coverage for the first time and for a first time purchase my daughter was berated and called irresponsible because there is an accident on her record This man does not know the circumstances involved in that incident and did not try to help her by seeing if he could reduce potential premiums by increasing deductibles etc My daughter is a magna cum laude graduate with a major and two minors a four year basketball player in college tutor to her teammates a volunteer Spanish interpreter and all while working two or more jobs That is irresponsible My father is a career government employee FAA and we had forever This certainly shows why I have it now and it belies the nice cuddly image the gecko is trying to convey  
 I had a policy for our two that included collision liability etc I sold of the and bought another so I took off the policy and added the new in its place At the time I added the to the policy their web interface made it seem as though I was adding the same policy to this newer with the same coverage I agreed and updated the policy to be for the new and drove around happily ignorant that my new policy did not include collision and was in fact liability only They did not make this clear to me until I was in an accident yesterday and when I called in my claim I was denied coverage for the I never would have purchased a liability only policy and I feel like I was tricked into this because does not want to pay to fix people's They have essentially been taking my money for the past months and never once indicated to me that my new policy did not include collision Had they made any indication to me at all that I needed to go in and re select these options when adding a I would have certainly included collision on the But screwed me over and now I am left with a broken and no money to fix it as I was laid off two weeks ago when my company shut down Do not go with under any circumstances All they want is your money and have no intention of helping the people they are supposed to be protecting  
 On the th of November my ' Suburban was stolen When I first called I made sure to tell them I had custom rims stereo and paint When I first started the policy I I want all of this covered regardless of price They a month Okay fine I talked to the adjuster on Thursday He   Call me in the morning of Friday    I did He me    on the rims I figure out the stereo and back with you    I   What about the paint    He nothing I say ** them If I could I would tell the whole world to run from even think about calling them to a quote Liars  
 Right from the start of my policy it has been a headache and it has not stopped Starting my policy they had the wrong year of the SUV They inverted the numbers seemed like a simple mistake although it changed my rate drastically Then there was the call to correct the years They it was to be a charge for the change in policy as if I was a new When I tried to explain the simple mix up it turned into a big thing After over an hour on the phone it fixed but not without frustration Then the rates fluctuated monthly I was always calling because the auto pay took out too much or took it out on the wrong day The calls were always frustrating having to go over every aspect of my policy because it was always differently interpreted by every operator I always ended up upset due to the actions of the employees They failed to update my moves costing me more money when I called in to correct their mistakes Then there was the new That was a god awful mess Instead of removing the SUV and adding the they added a to my policy causing me to pay for two After a ridiculous amount frustrating phone calls still incorrect addresses and to top it off rude and disrespectful   customer service associates   after all of the confusion I still could not tell you if they had credited me back the proper amount It took about two months to correct They were no help when I into an accident The adjuster stood me up a few times and I had a ton of hassles trying to info between companies I had to do all the work I had to do all the faxing and mailing and calling Witnesses and the police report was in my favor the other driver was cited failed to my deductible back failed to the repairs paid for on my and did not help at all I lost more than money on an accident that was not my fault and no support from Why The other driver argued saying it was not their fault nothing for me As if that is not enough my husband had to go to California for a long term work project We planned for me to move in January He was ahead Thinking I was doing the right thing I called to stop the auto pays because my husband was closing that bank account I informed them I would be moving to California in months I also them I was to be driving to California and would be there for three weeks then back and forth a few times I was trying to be proactive I did not think I needed to explain any of the private details of my family’s affairs nor did anyone from attempted to contact me to obtain any more information I would have if asked The move was for business and required me to have some mail forwarded to California pertaining to our business underwriters changed my policy to California without asking They their info from a piece of a phone call and from forwarded mail They changed the amount of my policy without telling me They they had mailed it to me they sent it to California That would have been fine if I was in California They also failed to stop the auto pay I am still trying to find out how much they cost me in overdraft fees I called yet again frustrated and upset I spoke to   Darrell   who is supposedly a service supervisor argued with me and made me feel very uncomfortable He me to sue I have to say that this was of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had He laughed at me I am not impressed nor do I feel like a valued paying customer I feel manipulated cheated and abused

 My wife's was hit in the rear by a insured driver The is in her name Throughout the whole process I handled the claim When I called to schedule the rental they could not talk to me   for privacy issues   The claim adjuster gave me a check made out to her Why they were capable of dealing with me up to that point and not subsequently is beyond me I had on my list to consider a quote but it is now off the list  
 I had an accident on and due to and their terrible claims service it is still not resolved I am completely in shock that they are able to handle their business like this They do not return phone calls When I called them my wait time is over an hour I be on weeks with no and it is very frustrating I would not recommend anyone doing business with them  
 In August I called in to make a payment after having taken my account off auto payments I was I had to pay current as well as days in advance I paid the first payment that day and the remainder weeks later In September when I called in to make the next payment I was I had to pay twice again After taking the CSR round and round in attempts to understand why I had to pay twice again I was again that I had to pay days in advance I went ahead and made a payment that day and another weeks later That was two months and payments I called tonight to make my payment payment was due according to the notification I in email As we are reviewing the account the CSR me that payments would be due in December I lost my cool cut through all the harsh words I had for the CSR and inform you that I am now looking for a different company If anyone out there knows of an honest company please leave a reply on this board Thanks  
  Auto The company attracts new customers with lower rates but gradually over time it increases rates without defensible cause Also the company refuses to defend most small claims and arbitrarily accepts liability This allows them to further increase their premiums Customer service is acceptable on general issues but their claims department is awful We had an Allstate policy for over twenty years Very disappointed we ever left them  
 I had an accident in February and the responsible party's paid for some things required that I do my PIP claim because in the state of Florida we are a   no fault   state so we have to do a PIP claim But they also forced me to do a PIP claim through the father of my children's company because they were in the Now his company is Progressive and neither he nor his was involved in the accident Now I want with company and due to the two PIP claims that put on my I am ineligible for with company and they have increased my premium The agent from the company that I received the quote from and the agent from Progressive that this was not a normal procedure used by companies to charge two companies including that was in no way involved in the accident Due to there being two claims in accidents that I was not responsible for I am unable to with company and therefore being punished for nothing I did wrong  
 A black truck ran red light and caused a collision with your which was exiting the intersection at the time The other driver had fake witnesses who accuse you of running the red light all the way and they also say the black truck came first and you third The police at the time care about analyzing what was being or the physical evidence They automatically say   your fault   because the fake witnesses say so without explanation also places you at fault because the fake witnesses say so even though their statement is unrealistic inconsistent and physically impossible to have occurred Their excuse for placing you at fault is because the fake witnesses are more believable in court than using real facts This was the decision made by ** of San Diego and his supervisor of the claims department is only good for home and other stuff but not for auto You best buy from somewhere else  
A customer hit my truck in a drive thru backed up into me and there goes my lunch break Then we made the swaps I have to go take my truck to their body shop in house cheapskates The adjusters me to have to replace my whole front bumper Nope They go the cheap route and replaced the top pieces and stopped I have a piece bumper Well now frustrated because they lied Now they want to fix my bumper This company and Auto Crafters are the worst companies to ever encounter 
 I have been driving for more than years I even begin to name the countries around the world that driven in I spent six years in the U S Army in Vietnam and Europe and years in the Navy In all this time I never had an accident or a ticket And I always have because the law In October I purchased a brand new Bright Red Dodge Ram pickup truck That had full coverage on it On June I had an automobile accident with a Ford Contour The Ford attempted to make a left turn in front of me The driver had no driver's license or A little eight year old girl in the back seat did not have a seat belt on She was the only fatality Because this was my first accident I assumed that my company would take care of this claim in a fast and efficient manner In the beginning right after the accident declared my a total loss with only miles But a week later a new adjuster an estimate to repair my at their auto body shop for and four months later their auto body shop was paid an additional plus I paid them that was my uninsured motorist check to the company’s repair shop a grand total of After the repairs were made I started asking about the appreciated value and shortly after that they decided to declare the a total loss They then paid off the vehicle’s depreciated value of and my gap policy paid the remainder that was due to capital Auto Finance months after the accident For nine months I paid per month truck payments that totaled I sent those bills and other bills to my company but in the end I still had to pay all the receipts I sent to out of my own pocket I went to because I watched their commercials and assumed they were the best but I left because of their claims department And care less if they lose you as a customer And not ask why Everybody I show or tell about this accident all walk away in all Put it bluntly not save you any money If anything it cost you And if you are a government employee or U S military then USAA save you more money every month and year than  
 My wife and I switched from to State Farm I come to find out soon that my license was suspended I was trying to some other quotes from some other companies and of them me that the computer was coming up saying that my license was suspended I was confused so I called my company State Farm and I talked with of the agents She checked my license and me that it was and that she would look into the matter quickly She soon found out that called the Utah DMV and them that I had a lapse in which I I had switched it over back to back State Farm proceeded to tell me that of the underwriters called and asked them if I needed an SR and I did State Farm's underwriter that I After two days of this mess I was able to my license reinstated If it for State Farm my license would still be suspended but most of all this was fault So if anyone wants to go to and soon finds out that you are not happy then you need to make sure that you switch with all of the paperwork in order because if not then make sure to make your life a living hell Also they like to pay out if you into an accident and as well as if it was of their own clients' fault in general is a very bad company  
 On September rd my a Jaguar XJ was vandalized My interior was stolen rear seats door panels wood package grill hood ornament I filed the theft with the Metro Police Department and then contacted They gave me a shop to bring it to and had it towed there and informed me that Sabrina from would be contacting me I waited for a week and then pursued contacting Sabrina with no avail Her customer concern is disgraceful After chasing her for a week and a half I was informed by her that there was an investigation related to my claim and a woman named Anita would be handling that She also informed me that she was unable to locate the parts needed to fix my After two weeks of again chasing to give me some completion on my claim Anita me she closed my case it was never explained why there was an investigation me thinking that it was normal procedure but never a straight answer from and that I now had to deal with Sabrina again After once again leaving numerous messages only being able to speak to her if she answered the phone her response to me was that she was not able to find the parts needed I now felt it was time for me to do their job with success in locating every part that was needed for a cost of and for installation When I relayed this information to Sabrina she insisted that the parts were not available but when she disrespected me with her determination of the value of my total value she was able to come up with a price to replace the which included the parts but could not tell me where she a price for them if she find them The problem with me regarding that is they are all over the internet Sabrina's famous comment is that it take her a few more days to give me an answer to their decision until after month of basically pushed around I demanded an answer After all the frustration on top of that after finally she back to me not only was I nothing but I was short of covering my deductible I have now for the last week been emailing Sabrina to deliver my and she refuses to answer my request  
 My husband was rear ended by someone who had We also filed with our company so we could go ahead and the repaired We called times wk requesting this claim to be handled and never resolution They've switched the claims handler on us times so additionally we never know who to call It is three months since the accident and we even gotten our deductible back There was an accident report filed and everything so not like any investigating had to be done This is a terrible company with terrible customer service I was to file a complaint with the BBB but they even registered with them Now I know why Since I cannot action out of the company I am creating my own action and I post this review on every review website I can  
 I want to make everyone aware that if you are insured with and own a new you should consider changing companies This is why I was involved in an accident on the st of September other person’s fault However the girl only carried state minimum therefore my is required to pick up the tab and try to collect from the girl who made the left in front of me I have a Highlander valued the at without tearing it down the estimate is now at for repairs with aftermarket parts refuses to use OEM parts and now tells me there is no way for me to recover diminished value of my because their policy clearly states that there is no provision for diminished value What this means is that my Highlander has lost a considerable amount of value because of the accident and aftermarket parts Buyer beware sucks  
 In June of this year my Subaru was hit receiving heavy damage while it was parked by a insured Even after I sent them a copy of the accident report and my rental receipt they sent me letters saying my claim is being delayed I have called them several times ensuring each time that they have everything On September they sent me letter stating my claim was being delayed due to non receipt of the rental bill I called on September and sure enough the person I talked with brought it right up on the computer After I off the phone I made two phone calls to the lawyer and to the Better Business Bureau should change its name it should never claim to represent government employees  
 We filed a claim with for an ambulance service or more days ago and the absolute ** in your claims department stated it could take up to days to settle I care if you settle with your client or not I provided a service that their policy covers and I want to paid Your claims people are absolutely rude Very poor representation  
 Very disappointing outcome slow response Hope you use this information before you choose your company My wife was involved in an accident on August Rear end incident damaging the bumper trim and panel on the side of new Ford Edge Police were called and the driver presented as her carrier We reported the incident as well to our This incident was nearly seven weeks ago Our company that was having trouble verifying proof of Yesterday I a letter from telling me they need more days to gather   relevant information   Really that would give them over two months to tell me if the person had or not Today I called them and after elevating my calls to a manager they me that most likely the person had had their lapse and they were to deny this claim My complaint is this With modern day computers knew the moment that claim was presented that this person had expired and should have refused the claim at that time with a written notice In turn this would have given me an opportunity to file paperwork to take this to small claims court while also informing the police department that investigated the incident that the individual provided false information to a police officer regarding coverage Meanwhile for nearly seven weeks we to drive around in a damaged how fun I understand that is denying the claim frustrated about the timing Had I not have acted today to to the bottom of this add days Not sure if their plan was to buy all this time with no regard to individuals waiting on a response very poor customer response or concern for people I have some friends who recently me about and how much they save I had planned on reviewing my home health and auto needs with them but I think I stay put Saving money sometimes is not worth the headache you from poor service I do want to state that the person s that I talked with were very pleasant so I would like to give credit for this  
 Customers beware let this Happen to you offer great customer service to you until you commit Be careful how when you cancel your policy They like that and charge you for the remainder of your term even though you covered by their They line their pockets while emptying ours We sent a policy letter of cancellation This was days after the st payment They promptly sent us a bill for the next months full amount We live on SS and are now paying for with companies because of days Furthermore the reason we switched companies is their coverage is rock bottom and their rate is not much better than competitors like Progressive We would like to know if possible to be relieved of paying the next months We paid of today not happy We have to go without something every month until that is paid in full Makes us sick to see how companies abuse you  
 I gave permission for to take money from my savings account in the beginning of the year At tax time I gave permission for that time only to take money out of my account for months Well the next months is due and and I went to take money out to pay my child's daycare and mind you I am a single mother of two and to find that I had bucks left in my account is not cool So now my children not be able to go to daycare until I pay my amount due This is a huge inconvenience to me I called and explained this to them They my money be refunded into my account I had to make a minimum payment of and waited forever while calling my bank to make sure the they took out of my account cleared I have time for all this super angry and be looking into other companies due to this issue So I stayed on the phone for over minutes hung up on a way to my bank because they closed Now I have to wait for a call at tomorrow to fix all of this This should have never freaking happened in the first place I am beyond pissed and to find out I money refunded to my account for business days after I talked to my bank on a way call to make sure the was cleared Totally switching Thanks **  
My son and I moved six policies to this year My son had an accident and it was not his fault We pay full coverage on all six policies and his claims examiner him to talk to the other company and handle the claim his self The has been parked and is still having my son talk to the other company We be moving six policies after this claim is done has the worst claims department that I have ever dealt with and I have had for over years 
 I have been an excellent driver and have an excellent record I have a single speeding ticket or even a warning on my record However I am forced to pay about per quarter for auto through Please note that they recently lowered that rate only slightly Other companies either give me the same rate or a higher when I ask for quotes Times are tight enough and I clobbered by a large medical bill that took away my   cushion   some time ago I cannot afford to pay these ridiculous rates and I want an explanation as to why I have to pay so much  
 I was in an accident with a insured driver over a month ago The insured driver t boned my as she backed out of a parking space My was already in the aisle and I was in drive The insured driver did not use her mirrors and was relying on her camera as she backed out After a month of the runaround with to my fixed they are now denying responsibility I have photos of the damages and their driver admitted to not using her mirrors Talk about a waste of time fully insured with Allstate and my rep has already scheduled me to my estimated tomorrow Allstate go after for the damages My main complaint with is that they gave me the runaround for over a month I had to repeatedly call them for status updates As of two weeks ago they admitted responsibility and sent me to my estimated I called them today to a status since I heard a peep from them I a disgruntled representative on the line stating that they are now denying responsibility Seriously if you were to deny responsibility give people the runaround has proven to be unprofessional and unresponsive You should seriously reconsider when looking for I imagine how treats their insured drivers thanking my stars that I am under Allstate who has proven to be extremely responsive Sure they cost more but the time you save is immeasurable  
 On May I was in an accident with a insured driver I was stopped at a light waiting to make a left hand turn I drive a Dodge Durango On my left side there is turning lane to turn left and there was a large minivan in that lane When the light turned green the minivan driver and myself proceeded to move As we were moving I noticed that the minivan was attempting to slam on brakes and stopped suddenly and at that same moment I was hit from the left side by the insured driver who ran the red light I did not see the driver coming until the minivan driver had stopped and I was able to see pass the minivan That minivan was as large and as tall as my Durango and there was no way for me to see over it to see that the other driver was coming Once I did see the other driver it was too late for me to stop I slammed on brakes hoping to avoid an impact at my driver door The other driver caused damage to my front bumper They had damage to their passenger doors It’s almost like they skidded across my bumper A police officer did show up about minutes later and after we were moved out of the road in to an adjacent parking lot The officer took down everyone's information He me that he was not to write up a police report because he felt as though the damage was not extensive enough and we could handle between each other with no problems He verbally me that he did feel the other driver was responsible He also stated that he was not to give me a ticket or the other driver The officer then stated that the other driver did not have his card but the driver that he had and the officer gave me the other driver's info written on a small accident report form I did not realize how much that would be a problem later on The driver of the minivan also stayed on scene and acted as my witness to prove that I was not at fault The officer also stated that the other driver was complaining that I did not a ticket I did not think anything of it because I knew the witness gave the officer all of the information and proved that I was not at fault Later denies the claim saying that their driver is saying that he had a green light I contacted the officer to have him contact the companies to give his testimony but the officer never followed up with the companies Then says that there might have been a malfunction with the light that day and there was no witness saying that the light was not green for his insured My witness specifically them that the other driver ran the red light and that the other driver almost hit them instead of me Come on Then tried to throw in a bunch of other nonsense about the damage to my showing that their insured was not at fault I don’t even understand that The claim went to subrogation and denied It has now gone to arbitration but I have a feeling that deny the claim again needs to take responsibility for their drivers and stop coming up with these bogus claims and information It makes no sense to make someone else go through all of this  
 While sitting at a red light perfect evening suddenly I hear the dreaded sounds of tires screeching to stop   Wham Crash boom    I am struck in the back of my F pickup so hard it drives me into the Jetta in front of me and propels both completely through the intersection I am stunned and shocked but in piece as the Sonoma pickup that struck me had completely lifted my F up in the air and somehow spun out the driver's side into the oncoming lane The Sonoma driver lady exits and says   This my fault   to the total disbelief of myself the other folks in the Jetta and anyone else that had heard it Okay Well the Sonoma driver is taken to the hospital for injuries and tox screen I called next day to file claim against them I too far into the process next day The rep claims unauthorized driver and is not accepting liability Sonoma driver tells State Police she was coming back with food for her and her boyfriend who owns the Sonoma I found out in my investigation her boyfriend has had his license suspended less than days before therefore could not drive legally but he drove to the scene and screamed at his girlfriend for wrecking his truck before police and ambulance arrived treated me like a criminal When I did research I found that the driver and her boyfriend have a very sorted past run ins with the law claims that the Sonoma driver neither confirmed nor denied she had permission to drive the Anyway three weeks later no progress has not forwarded the necessary denial of coverage forms to my company so they process my claim is flat out bad news Cancel now I have never seen an company act so terribly = Garbage  
 On April my suffered a rainwater flood damage My sat for about hours in the water my had only miles when it water damage and now already spent about and still not ready yet and Hacienda Ford due to adjuster and his supervisor are stating that I am annoying the dealer's staff They now refused to fix my claiming the has defective parts from Ford The is a Fusion and it was running perfectly until the water damage Hacienda Ford replaced about worth and when they knew transmission was needed they refused to continue with the work Now Boggus Ford in McAllen TX spoke with whom they talked bad about me The is still fixed at Boggus Ford and now the is way more than if decided to total the as the electrical may start giving more issues putting my family at risk  
 I had renewed my policy online and had to sign up for auto payment So I did I called in June about my rates and how they had gone up I was not happy with that I advised the CSR to take me off of auto draft So Aug I was at a grocery store and tried paying with my debit card It would not go through I called them back and they me had taken out of my account OMG I called and them they need to reverse charges because this was making my account to go in overdraft They did not care bit They they could not reverse charges and would have a supervisor call me Monday Monday I called them and spoke to a manager she me the same thing I have been with for years I was never late on a payment I may have had to a little more time now and then but always paid They would not do anything for me So I cancelled my policy and go somewhere else I still have to pay for overdraft fees and only half my money back from I never ever recommend to anyone  
 I am flat out disgusted with On August st I purchased an auto policy from them at a set rate which quite honestly was not all that competitive I did as well with quotes from Allstate Century and Progressive However I chose because a few of my family members use this company and I thought they treated their customers well Wow was I wrong After this policy was quoted to me online I proceeded to pay the down payment with my credit card They accepted payment and that being I expected they would standby the price quoted Again I was wrong An agent called me nine days later stating that I would have to pay more per year Yes When I asked why the excuse was absolutely absurd She this was due to the fact that I have not been insured for the past three years However I have not had a for the past three years Why would I need to have if I do not have a I was then accused by the agent of driving my fiancé’s while being uninsured I truly did not appreciate that They are a company not the police and have no right to question me on why I have not been driving for the past three years Not that any of their business but I worked in an urban area and was able to take public transportation to and from work I recently a new job and had a child so circumstances have changed I guess well normal life circumstances mean nothing to this company rather spend their customer’s hard earned money on insulting advertising They should be ashamed I do not see how in the world this company supposedly has a % satisfaction rate or how the best in New Jersey pretty sure they made those statistics up on their own because done my research online and have found thousands upon thousands of dissatisfied customers who are aware of their shady business practices The only people singing their praises are their own employees Biased you think Due to all of this I cancelled my day policy with them When I called to cancel the agent has the audacity to ask me if consider staying if she could save me some money I her that unless she save me per year I am not interested Of course she couldn't so funny how six other companies were able to quote me anywhere from less than and the fact that I been driving for the past three years does not affect my rates or have minimal effect on them Some of the agents from the other companies even laughed when I them was to charge me an extra for this agent claimed that factor made me go from an excellent driver to an average driver Average never had so much as a parking ticket Not other company quoted me as an average driver I was named as an excellent driver by every single other company I received a quote from and received a huge discount with all of them because of it All of those companies they base it on total years driving not the fact that I did not have a for the past few years Even if you were to knock three years off of my driving time that still gives me years of experience on the road and would make me a year old female as opposed to a year old female which still makes me a low risk driver Also I find it rather suspicious that their agents noticed this nine days after I purchased the policy and paid for it Somehow I think that is completely legit Furthermore I never agreed to the new rate yet they made it effective on their website and intended to bill me for it yet I never signed anything or even consented verbally Again not too sure if that is on the up and up Overall I think what did is ridiculous Fifteen minutes cannot save me % or more It cost me % more and % more aggravation I switched to a company who I know is of their largest competitors Their agent did everything she could to save me well over % I cannot say the same for any agents All I was a lot of   there's nothing I do   responses Way to go  
 They tried to charge me for a period of time that I was insured by auto company because I dropped them to go with a cheaper company I gave them proof that I was insured by company and they dropped the charge Now they are sending me a letter which does not explain the charges for which magically increased to when I talked to a representative The robot I spoke to claimed that NC charges a fee when a customer cancels before six months So I am now being charged because I canceled which the issue before It seems they find a way to charge me initially because I had the brains to submit proof so they came up with reason Such avarice deserves a penalty of imprisonment Happy Karma  
 Reimbursement for Repair Did you know that only covers aftermarket or recycled parts and not OEM when you need repairs I replaced my broken grill with an OEM grill but would only pay for an aftermarket grill about half the cost of an OEM grill and refused to pay cent What's more the page of the policy which says that had to be downloaded online as they never sent such a page to me when I purchased my from them Check your policy  
 On Friday July I changed my policy online and updated my phone number I have been calling around for quotes because our through was up We hadn't filed any claims or anything After speaking with three reps from other companies Allstate State Farm and Liberty Mutual I realized our deductible was The reason being was we had two but now only have one They suggested we lower them and acquire rental coverage as well since we only have now I did change the deductible but want the rental Lo and behold my husband hit the garage at our apartment complex on Saturday claims adjuster to me that while they want to agree to the and that it was indeed in effect they need proof that he hit the garage on Saturday and not before They asked us for witnesses There any except the lady who rents the garage next to the my hubby hit Her garage was bent and open anymore She was willing to give statement that her garage was fine on Friday but as of Saturday afternoon it was broken Now they need her statement They are saying the in effect on Saturday It cannot be changed until renewal I online and went through the process to change the policy and lo and behold been changed since Monday when I gave my recorded statement They are rude and we have had to call numerous times to anyone to call us back We are still awaiting a response from them but they say it look good We have to pay the most likely  
 I switched to about a year and a half ago because of the good rates but I wish I never did I was hit twice while parked on the street and because I have the right coverage would not cover the damage which I had expected I did not file a claim with DMV or even a police report because there was no point This happened within the first months of being insured I had no other problems or accidents since and now all of a sudden a year later I received a letter stating I was being dropped from my because of too many accidents It turns out that even though I never made a claim or received even a penny from they still counted it against me When I tried to call and complain about being dropped the underwriters lied to me over and over again They tried to tell me the accidents were reported from DMV or police reports that they received and that I was too much of a risk When I looked into new my agent me that there were no DMV or police reports on my record I have never had an accident or even a ticket in my life yet care they are the worst company ever I would tell anyone to think twice about being insured by them because you be trading a lot for a good rate and it worth it  
 We used to have Progressive for about eight years with a very clean driving record We switched over to in December I paid the first month and a statement reflecting only months The first payment in December reflect as month of the months We moved to CO in January was changed on the th We paid which reflects on the new policy The billing statement again says five months The only changes that were added were increasing the rental to max from We had comp collision underinsured and uninsured Company law states that medical has to be on the policy This was never expressed to me and never added They stated I rejected it when in fact I never did They tried to bill me twice in the month of February All payments were made accordingly still to this day I know why they were billing me twice in February In March of I notified the lienholder x previous company and that the safe and the dealership that we purchased it from was aware of this from the day we bought it Roughly two weeks later I a letter from that I cannot have the looked at anywhere and they have to decide and they have to approve of it The letter appeared to be as if I was in an accident when in fact I wasn't Around the th of April I a cancellation notice from I called and asked what was this pertaining to The gentleman   For the lack of payment      We even sent you in February Why did you accept my payments over the phone    I asked I him that all payments are accounted for I even expressed that I am disabled and I need to save some money to take the rental off and the roadside assistance off I never asked to remove comp collision and anything that would protect us and the lienholder On the statement was re instated and the payments were taken out automatically unlike before On a truck abruptly swerved into my lane from the right and back into his lane because of the safeness of the vibrating uncontrollably at various speeds and pulling to the left I had little room to downshift or brake When I was able to brake the pulled me into the median into oncoming traffic I was safely able to to a final stop in front of a fire department The fireman called the police which they never showed up as Obama was in town declaring emergency I was yelling on the phone with the asking how this is possible I have full coverage I paid for a tow and I made it very clear that they need to put the policy back to what it was in January Not only was the man rude he never asked if I was okay or if EMS needed to be called He stated   Based on the conversation we have in April you to remove the comp collision    I him I want a copy of the transcripts He then hung up On I spoke to Janelle I expressed my anger with and the fact they not I took the lienholder off of the I requested a copy of the recordings again I was no I her that the phone call in the beginning states that the call be recorded for training purposes It wasn’t the written transcripts she again no Why was I cancelled when payments were made He “You did not elect to have them automatically withdrawn ” I Janelle that this isn’t mandatory He then “You didn’t make all of your payments ” I her that I paid January February due the th and the th and was made in March I also paid in January He “We would have to credit that to you ” I also asked why are you trying to collect on the AZ amount when the policy was changed in January He “That is what you owe ” If anything you owe me a credit “No we don’t ” she I asked if they are to look at the She “No Why What is the purpose It’s totaled anyhow I’m not an adjuster ” The gentleman knew there was a lienholder and took them off They require the to be covered Why didn’t he tell me what he was doing and that the has to be covered for the lienholder “I don’t know ” she She hung up on me I the new policy that has yet effective The does not have the lienholder nor does it have the mandatory medical per law It says I rejected I never did I found out about it after the accident The lienholder has never sent us a letter stating “The has to be put back on or we charge you so much to cover it ” Also I don’t know how much is due to come out and when I never received the statement amount or refunded for April May or June and of course December of last year Again the wording on the back of the declaration page says   We made adjustments to your claim and we removed the lienholder ” Not I as I requested I never did I am in a dispute and have to keep the on the and make payments on a totaled The is totaled for two reasons previous damage from ownership and they know the is unsafe in writing and current damages I have had a difficult time trying to find someone to help especially on a contingency basis I am disabled and I afford an attorney for both matters The being a lemon and the sale of the was an illegal transaction and because there bodily injury There are punitive damages depression anger misrepresentation mistrust fraud bad faith negligence and I have missed very important doctor appointments for my illness Be careful if you want to save money The only thing that is cute about is the gecko Everything else is a scam It is very difficult to see a nice totaled in my garage and smile when nothing is being done about it All I say is I am alive Yet this enough I paid the company to protect me and other consumers that pay this scheister company If I was not disputing this matter I would drop them before my next heartbeat I want my replaced the bank to know what they did and to pay full value of the without depreciation their license to be revoked indefinitely and cannot go in business under any type of alias  
A Cadillac was stolen in front of my house and wrecked I have total comprehensive with no deductible valued the at % of the fair market value and wanted to take the away immediately I refused and tried to negotiate a better settlement I was I could not have the fixed or buy it back because it was a theft They would not negotiate a better settlement and stopped paying storage on the They also dropped the on the been a month and nobody knows anything when I call them 
 The agent I spoke to on the phone was very rude After over years with this company they are not very customer friendly They want to charge me for two deductibles for the same damage with amounts to The whole bill to fix my is only They I had to wait over a week for an adjuster to look at my I be looking for company is great as long as you have to use them  
 I once again wanted you to know how upset I am with The supervisor in the Springs Jessica called to let me know that there was no way my windshield was hail damaged My goodness ridiculous She no other company cover that window This is the worst I have dealt with I asked for her supervisor and all she me was her name is Renee She hung up on me before giving me her number telling me that she approve it either She the hail makes a circle on your windshield when it hits it Did she look at it No She she already had a professional look at it So she says lying Has anybody else had a cracked windshield from hail without it having a circle It hit the very top of my windshield and hood You take my money but honor your policy  
 We had a terrible hailstorm in Colorado hail stones bigger than eggs and in some areas bigger than baseballs My little PT was beaten to death making dents all over and cracking the windshield Today I went to Global Collision thinking I was to an estimate I was my appointment is set for today to repair Nice if I had been that I showed the rep the windshield he glanced at it and   That's not hail damage Hail damage has a certain look so we cover that    It must be that the Global Collision is owned by They cut me a measly check of and have a good day  
 On March I was rear ended by a insured My is unusable I gave it two weeks in good faith I called to see where things stand After uploading my pictures of the accident and my police report they finally accepted liability I waited for week then I called They had not notified the adjuster of their accepting liability They notified Adjuster Adjuster he could have a check for me It was well under what it cost to replace my These guys work for Enough This is where the claim basically stands This is June No and an offer of a check which not cover replacing my As per **   The TX Dept of is not a regulatory agency not a court of law thus we cannot make a determination of disputed claims    Really I am not sure of the function of the Texas Department of is as an agency My recommendation is to research before thinking about doing any business with them  
My was in an accident and for the party at fault repaired the I have filed a claim for the diminished value I have been talking to Rafael ** on this claim I submitted a complete analysis of the diminished value for the I have not heard from him after that nor has he been returning my calls I would appreciate if the agent could be a little more courteous and return my call I would like to know a decision on the claim so I plan my next steps I would appreciate a response on my diminished value claim 
I was hit from behind by a insured and an adjuster to look at the I must make an appointment so they push you to use their body shop They should be stopped 
 My sat in a tow yard over the weekend and then was picked up to go to the body shop While at the tow yard or the repair shop someone stole over worth of electronics out of my When I contacted they it was not their responsibility although the was there with a adjuster The was returned with no gas It was unable to be driven and had a full tank when dropped off The repair work was terrible and the bumper was not put back on correctly It be back to the repair shop I am very unhappy with them and I be looking for a new provider asap  
 My policy says full glass coverage for my camper Now being only if the weather is bad or someone throws a rock through it That means partial glass coverage That is false advertising I purposely paid extra for full glass coverage But now being not full glass but partial glass coverage They have a complaint dept so who would know how many others have had the same issue They care  
 My husband and I moved from WI to NJ last year We new through A few months later we bought a and called them to coverage including collision and comprehensive on the Two weeks ago my husband into a accident only to discover dropped our collision and comprehensive because we had not taken the in for a photo identification We received no notice to do so because we had moved from temporary to permanent residence and had our new address and email address but instead sent the mail to the old address and received it back with   undeliverable   Instead of trying to contact us via email they dropped us without further notice We only found out we had no when we needed it repairs cost us and more in dissatisfaction Last night we switched to Liberty Mutual  
 My was damaged by a policy holder It would take me hours to type all I have been through I cannot anyone to call me back I have called about times left messages on the website even of the Facebook site They listen to you take your name and number and say they have someone to call you back No calls me back Please if you are thinking of this check around They are horrible  
 I was involved in a accident and I did not have I know Trust me I feel bad for not being able to afford it I clipped a guy whose ended up with a minor dent and scratch while I was injured and totaled my already paying for the ticket and all that I expected to pay for his bumper probably K But to my surprise came up with a couple bucks short of K Hahaha Of course the adjuster was not happy when I requested all the receipts and bills for K worth of damage and consulted a lawyer For kicks and giggles I contacted the recovery agency They send you to collections immediately deal with bills And they offered me a settlement for How in the world So I was right there was not that much damage to the and they want me to pay for their time say this is theft If anybody bothered to contact me we could come up with all kinds of conclusions But their sneaky clandestine invoice through collections agency not them far at least in my case I pay for what I have done but greedy corporations really need to back off  
 I was a pedestrian crossing at the crosswalk with the right of way when I was struck by a insured on I was brought to the hospital in an ambulance I was hospitalized for two days I injured about every part of my body They are covering part for my neck but denied it for my knees I was out of work for a month and a half I submitted my tax returns W s and the packet of forms along with medical documentation I brought the forms in person to the office faxed them and mailed them My HR and my doctor have returned their required forms Now over three months later they still refuse to pay my lost wages under NY state no fault In addition to suing I file a complaint with the NYSID in the near future They spend billions on advertising TV radio Internet mail see it on billboards buses subways LIRR but God help you if you ever file a claim This company is nothing but a scam  
 I used to like the little guy on the TV commercials I never knew much about never really needed to know May schooled me on While at a stop light the light turned green and it was my turn to go I proceeded and within seconds a red light runner slammed not a mark on it into my Camaro all from the front and on the driver's side and the door was gone I an adjuster fresh out of school He has to be Mr Jason ** has the Camaro at + miles when it has yet to hit He stated the accident happened at am It was in the afternoon Many mistakes made but what the heck We all misspell right I wish that was the only case because he cannot write an estimate either Much more damage was missed I went to his supervisor a Shaun ** out of Houston I requested the typos be corrected first Oh he do that But by the end of the conversation he is asking how to correct My statement to him was that I did not want aftermarket parts put on my Camaro To me it is still a brand new and maintained that way He enjoyed this He there was nothing he do He stated that there was nothing he do to make me happy It always be something else I always want something else and it goes up the line to his boss Rick ** He stated is within every company's rights to put aftermarket parts on this and if I did not want the aftermarket parts put on it I go to my company and have them put the new parts on the The same quote came from his boss a Mark ** who is up in Dallas remark from him was industry accepted parts I am pissed Hell yes I am in a brand new that I maintained and a red light running driver changes all of that in a second And the three employees have a large laugh on me wanting new anything to be put on my I say tell me the bad and I page after page of pissed off consumers out there on the web that have been victims of % much worse off than me injured in some of their accidents Look it up and see what I am saying How come this cannot change How do the companies have so much authority How come we settle the banks down a bit but not the How come they cannot be regulated better and made to do right I a letter that gives me a notice required by law   By law you have the right to select where your motor is to be repaired and the parts used for repairs    Why send this I have the right to select the parts used for repairs I not forget you  
 My mother was rear ended by a customer as she was moving mph The witness stated in the police report that the customer appeared to be merging from the merge lane and struck my mother who was already on the main road with right of way The customer stated at the time of the accident my mother suddenly slowed down causing her to rear end my mother If my mother was already moving at mph it is unclear how fast this customer was driving to total out my mother's In a phone statement the customer came up with an elaborate story of how there was a truck and how my mother swerved and how the customer swerved and caused her to total out my mother's Clearly a fabricated story as if all that had happened she would have stated that in the police report at the day of the accident is with this fabricated story and first offered % which makes my mother more at fault than the person who struck her from behind They claim that the damage is in the quarter panel which is in line with the story being This is ridiculous as if you look at the photo the point of impact is at the bumper and the entire quarter panel crumpled forward The point of impact is not the quarter panel as they are claiming My mother was also rushed to the ER for x rays and CAT scans due to the tremendous damage that was caused to her She was sore and in pain but all we wanted was to be reimbursed for the and the rental fee that we accrued Do not use if you want to be sued because I probably end up suing the customer as well as What sense does it make to have a that refuses to pay when it comes time to pay that why we have  
 I flipped a three times into the field and cannot even the adjuster to take a look at it He was angry confrontational and argumentative from the very beginning of the conversation I did nothing to provoke this person He has a serious anger problem and I simply want my taken care of I have paid over ten thousand dollars throughout the years to with no previous accidents I am appalled at this company's behavior He also that they do not use Kelly Blue Book when estimating the price So what do they use Their own industry handbook most likely I am too shocked to write much else at this point  
 I go on for hours about how screwed me out of on claims First I am a year old Vietnam war vet I am also the father of a highly decorated Iraq Army Ranger My KIA was totaled in an accident I was not at fault The whole process was agonizing They low balled me on the value of my by Then they let the sit at an auction for salvage sale I returned all docs allowing them to sell for salvage with the receipts of the sale to go to me The auction company had a towing company pick up the and store it after did not follow through The was sold by lien by the towing company The was worth at least as salvage I called them and they lied I have proof of all the above During this time I had rental for days They refused to pay after days saying I had plenty of time to buy a new Salt in the wound They should be put out of business I was hurt in the accident not seriously Thank God to BMW airbags But they never replied on that issue the worst experience in my life with companies This has been a month ordeal I complained many times and there is a concrete shield in  
 I had the side of my scraped with a key I have been a customer for at least years I never had a claim No tickets no accidents I am years old I filed a claim and they not pay it because the Pathfinder I bought a year ago had previous work done to it in the area where the was keyed I paid my so that when I need coverage it is available I have been severely let down What we do the company have to pay to fix your  
 After having an accident sent checks to the auto body shop in my name and they cashed them without ever fixing my truck I had no idea that these checks were addressed to me and were cashed My name had been signed to these checks that they refuse to give to me worth Then I was that I was responsible for these unknown checks They refused to give me any copies of the checks where I take the body shop to court since they handle the situation This body shop is of the shops they recommended to me when they should have totaled out my if that much damage was done been months of being without my and they refused to involved in helping me retrieve it They tell you they call you back but you never hear from them at all They refused to even their fraud department involved as well I have never dealt with an company such as this and do not advise anyone to use their service In finding this web page I also found out that they have had class action lawsuits against them I would like to start a third They are on the news today now about their poor service to their customers very sad when the Ohio Department of is letting them completely keep away with what they are doing and not being shut down I guess has enough of everyone's money to keep a good attorney Who's to help us all  
  is an absolute ripoff beware They sell you and then when you try to submit a claim they force you to substitute substandard parts or windshields that are terrible in quality This results in reduction in the resale value or trade anyone who knows see a cheap knockoff been put in They are also unsafe as the windshield represents % of the strength and your roof cave in during a rollover accident Also if the windshield pops out in an accident which it is likely to do with a cheap substitute the airbag not deploy as it have nothing to deflect off of  
 I called to cancel my policy and the gentleman on the phone me to go online and type up   Please cancel my policy effective immediately    I did follow his instructions and did exactly what he I also him that I was supposed to be charged the next day and I wanted to stop the payments He me that he was unable to do it on his end and I would have to do it on my end So once again I followed his instructions and thought that I cancelled my policy Nevertheless I was charged the next day and my policy cancelled because they me that I provide a reason I was never to provide a reason And I guess I stop the automatic payments because this had to be done over the phone And the rep me that he do it So who is supposed to this done God I called again the next day and talked to rep and I was that the only way for me to a refund is via check Isn't that convenient When I asked to talk to her supervisor the supervisor basically blamed me for calling them really late not because they completely screwed up their own instructions has the worst rates customer service and cancellation policy They're like a stuck gum on your shirt that you rid of I wait to rid of them Not only I saved over a month on my policy with major policy provider I have to deal with their awful reps  
 I have been a customer of for three years with a young female driver She is a great student and has over a B average When I called customer service regarding her to college in the fall in Kansas they me that I lose my multi discount and this is causing my premium to go from a month to a month She is living on campus and only driving to her practice as she is an athlete and driving home at the end of the school year Probably she’s only driving about a total of miles a year I checked with seven other companies and no other companies do this to their clients I called four times and heard from the customer service representatives that this was the law that they had to write my daughter in Kansas to cover her in that state I asked what law says that I have to do this They could not answer I contacted a local professional agent and they me there was no such law I called back and spoke to agent and they a policy In other words a way to double your costs I was so angry I am ditching this company as they are out to you anyway they and care about their customers They especially like college kids that live at home Every other company that I spoke to as long as the is registered in my name and in Texas they still give the discount Way to go  
 I thought my experience with was bad until I read some of these letters Mine was a simple case of contacting me offering me a rate quote which I accepted Then when the first bill came it was % higher than we had agreed When I contacted I gave them the name of the rep I had talked to and informed them of the situation I was they were unable to locate that person and they were sorry But in spite of the rate quote that I had   supposedly   received my cost was to be the rate on the bill classic bait and switch My advice is avoid at all costs and report all problems to the attorney general for your state Maybe with enough complaints these clowns be run out of business  
 I've been a customer of for over years I delayed an auto payment by day and received a confirmation from them of this transaction I did this several days before the payment would be taken from my bank account I also sent them an email to confirm they do not double bill me I checked my bank account and it was overdrawn as a result of them not delaying the payment In addition they took the payment a few days later and my policy was paid in full Then put the payment through again I spoke to customer service and even a supervisor Laura ** They do anything they me it was my error How could it be my error when I have a confirmation email from them prior to the payment Then they charged me on my account Ms ** me it would be removed from my account but it been yet contacting my AG Pam Bondi and the Better Business Bureau about this I asked why they accurately bill customers and why would they continue to bill me once my account was paid in full I no real answer I believe this happened Their lack of customer service was shocking It was like they care about their customers even longtime customers I be renewing with them their error and they should take responsibility not blame customers I hope others check their billing and policy carefully  
 After several years and in good standing even though they kept raising my premium due to accidents Some of which I received a ticket for which were dismissed in court and in the others I was rear ended I received a letter in the mail that they would not renew my policy Subsequently with that letter came a second letter offering me the opportunity to continue the multi risk coverage they provide even though they could not offer me liability physical damage auto Why would I want to continue with any coverage with them I made a call this morning to see if they would make an exception based on the information I provided but they really care To top it off I went online to research and request additional quotes from other companies and although I did not request a quote from them they sent me one This has been quite the experience great customer service and customer loyalty  
 I had an accident on me that my was towed to an   unapproved   lot It took them weeks to the towed minutes to of their approved lots and week to decide to total my Now my policy only allows for me to have a rental for days refuses to extend the time even though it was their error in the towed It is now and they have yet to pay medical bill or send the lienholder the amount that was still owed on the not have they sent me the rest of the money so that I use it to I have spoken to a dozen people at and depending on who I speak with I a different story Does anybody have any suggestions I am a widow and need my desperately I have been catching rides to work with coworkers but sometimes that possible and had to miss work because I have a My fiance was also in the and had to miss weeks of work paid any of his medical bills or reimbursed him for his time off work either I know the lady that hit my who has also and they taken care of her auto repairs either so I know that my case an isolated incident  
 I brought my to Gerber Collision in Las Vegas has a claim adjuster there named Richard I came to pick up my on two separate occasions and the repairs were completely unacceptable Richard refused to repair the properly Finally the shop manager had the repaired correctly and it looked perfect except the rear camera was not working now Even though the damage was to the trunk and the camera had to be removed and the deck lid replaced Richard that they were not responsible for it I have spoken with They keep telling me James ** call me He is the field manager in Vegas He still has not called This is the worst company out there I switched from MetLife to save a few dollars Big mistake I never had a problem with MetLife back after I file suit against in small claims and resolve this issue  
 I did a quote from in reference to my son his license at age I was in order to obtain an accurate quote a deposit would be needed an RMV check would be done and if interested the deposit would become the first payment Then a policy would come into place This was done When they quoted me a different price to for six months they me all was okay nothing done no harm and thanks for considering them Well needless to say they sent over a A form in MA they automatically cancelled the policy with the current carrier because of the form I still have yet to obtain my credit from the quote bank notified and formal complaint done and now it’s been a hassle to my current back and effective to the policy date The lizard is slimy after all I would not refer them to my worst enemy  
 My was stolen from an auto shop It has been missing for three weeks The was recovered and would not start is saying because I took the van into the auto shop for a low coolant light and while the van was missing the coolant caused the problems to the engine and that was a pre existing problem I have a police report that the owner of the shop where I took my van was doing a lot of illegal stuff letting people drive my van and selling parts from my van to other people I do not understand how I would be liable for the the total cost of everything when the van was reported stolen and I have no knowledge of what went on with the van during the time it was missing I feel like already made up in their minds that they were not to total the van and give me the blue book value By the way I had full coverage on the van This situation is not fair to me because it was no fault of my own  
 My wife and I were involved in a   no fault accident   We hit a deer at mph We live in Montana Deer are common Fortunately we were not injured We called and reported the accident They seemed very professional with the claim but as the story grows our experience has been absolutely terrible frustrating and downright unprofessional How does this company still exist After reading blogs reports and page after page of websites created about ’s lies fraud robbery threats and incompetence why do they away with this They are not insuring people They are stealing from the American people Period So our was totaled A week later they would pay off the but not for what the value of what our was worth We that we were not happy with that amount They that was all that they were to give us no ifs and or buts Not a week later the adjuster called and that we needed to release the We no we have not agreed on a price and we have not seen any money No money no He then calls and threatens my wife by saying that if we do not release the we face serious consequences Not seconds after that call a auction company called and wanted to know if we had released the Who called them Finally we if he would agree to pay for the new tires on the we would go with their offer He that they would do that That leaves us with like a Not a good down payment to into something new but we were so tired of this whole scandal So then we find out that nobody seems to have the title to the Once again they say they not cut a check until they the title Well we have released the So now we are out of a no money and no title We know what to do We afford to pay a lawyer Once again we Americans taking advantage of by corporate America Keep us hungry and we stay under No compassion they all they can Please if you have any advice on what we do we would greatly appreciate it Thank you  
 A week and a half ago I was driving to work and the driver in front of me stopped short causing me to stop short as well It was a bit close but I did not hit the in front of me In a split second however it occurred to me that the behind me might not have as much   luck   as I did so I quickly glanced to my rear view mirror in time to see the Jeep Liberty smash into me and push me into the in front Somehow a second later I felt impact from the rear We out of our and a man came running across the street asking if we were hurt The girl in front and the lady in back both yes but something feel right so I   I'm not sure   The police were called Statements were given and the that struck me and pushed me into the in front was cited for   following too close   You could tell by all the fluid from her Jeep exactly where the first impact took place The behind me and me both has I spoke to family members later and they all me to watch out because when two parties have the same not as if they are to fight very hard to make sure you fair compensation for damages I shrugged that info off as them being paranoid Later on I the worst headache ever and before bed my neck became very stiff The next day my adjuster returned my call and a statement I I stopped and was then pushed into the in front of me but felt three impacts the first of which came from behind After my statement he me the girl in the in front she felt two impacts and that she I struck her first and was then pushed into her He they needed the police report to clear it up I went to the police station and picked up a copy of the report Then I went to a doctor who I had spasms in my back and neck muscles from the trauma and me I be at work and would need physical therapy and pain meds muscle relaxers the pain in my neck and back has been so bad at times since the accident that even on meds burst into tears The accident report as I expected the initial impact was when the Jeep Liberty hit me from behind I really thought that would clear everything up apparently not Turns out my family gives really good advice and paranoid at all So is saying that even though the police report says otherwise they are with what the girl in front is saying since according to them she is the only   innocent victim   and since I do not have collision on my I am % plus the deductible responsible for the damage to the front of my not to mention % responsible for the back end damage to the in front I also assume they deny part of the payment for my missed work and medical expenses Even better the girl in front who claimed no injury at the time of the accident has reported to that she hit her head once per each impact I guess better for both of them because not only does not have to pay for all of my repairs and medical but the girl in front now try and money from both myself and the lady who rear ended me to compensate for the head bumps she somehow forgot about immediately after the accident but then remembered a few hours later not sure I have any choice at this point but to a lawyer I did not hit the in front of me before I was rear ended and pushed into it The police report says the exact same thing As far as concerned as much an innocent victim as the girl in the in front I stopped before hitting her and if the lady in the rear was paying attention and leaving safe stopping distance I would be at work right now rather than sitting here in pain stressed out and wondering if there really is such a thing as justice in the world today has outright me that there is no evidence the guy who stopped to ask if we were okay must not have seen the crash because even though he talked to the cops nothing about him was mentioned in the report really really angry I am a very honest person and I like to think people usually care more about what's right rather than making a buck starting to see how naive that is In the past week and a half heard nothing but negativity about As soon as the dust settles taking my elsewhere I know pay more money because now been found liable for an accident that I had no control over I stopped before hitting the in front of me I have no control over someone speeding not paying attention and rear ending me but apparently care about that So my rates go way up but those upped rates be to  
 On March I gave a friend permission to drive my to pick up coffee He was hit by driver when she made an unsafe left turn across his lane of traffic She was coming out of a parking lot turning left Her view was obstructed by a large parked SUV She admitted to not seeing the driver of my until it was too late so she panicked and went for it any way The driver of my noticed her and stopped yet because she panicked she cut the turn too sharp and clipped the front end of my left bumper To make matters worse she stop until she had scraped the entire side of her and torn the fog lamp on my out of its socket not broken removed by the driver's door Now claims based on photos provided by both drivers that he hit her broadside and should have swerved or something to avoid the collision Meanwhile he was stopped Had he swerved left she would have hit him any way If he had swerved right he would have hit a parked Stopping seemed the best thing to do Here's the problem is assessing my policy % negligence for failure to yield yet the driver of my had the right of way and the other driver admitted she panicked and went for it And the police officer she was entirely at fault and the driver of my had stopped For the life of me I cannot figure out how the driver of my was negligent Additionally simple physics kicks in here It could not have happened the way the company it did because the would have spun into the driver's door of my by simple impact and the air bag would have deployed I guess the fault lies in being on the road that morning not a large amount of money we are arguing over but for me the principle of it By assessing fault to both drivers they charge both policies so as to increase rates it stays on my record as being partially to blame for the accident and it upsets me the most that the company counts on most insured to not question their assessment and accept their findings Personally I am tired of the hoax time that companies doing business in the United States adopt a policy of integrity and step up to the plate and do the right thing companies make millions of dollars every year and you into an accident that blatantly was no fault of yours and you are assessed blame wrong Then to top it off the supervisor now puts partial blame on the officer for not filling out the report thoroughly Wow How are you supposed to go up against an officer of the law Frankly it disgusts me I pay to insure me and then they still find a way to milk more money out and tell you the law I asked for a copy of the law but was never provided with one It further upsets me that the copies count on the insured to give up without a fight and then when you question them you are at fault  
 I was hit broadside by a insured driver They turned left into me on a lane highway at an intersection The driver was ticketed at the scene and two witnesses gave statements to State Police at scene The driver admitted fault to State Police I called that day and reported the accident with all facts I uploaded a diagram of the accident has done nothing No adjuster no rental not even a phone call So I called and was the insured has not answered returned phone calls from and until they do not help me They suggest that I go through my company Nationwide which I not do I would have to lay out my deductible and wait until settlement That may as well be a million Who has an extra bucks lying around Not me a smashed The bruises healed faster This what I expected as the injured party Much less than I expected Who knows when some help  
  sold us a policy on About a week later they added a year month policy increase because they claim my wife was involved in a not at fault was rear ended accident in They knew of this incident as we had reported it to along with a police report back in The accident was claimed and settled through the other party's company since he was at fault We were customers at the time of the accident as we had been for many years prior and up to as well In my opinion I believe they   low balled   me to me back as a customer then slammed me with this increase I know companies have a day period to verify re evaluate a new policy in case a customer omits critical information but in my case they clearly knew of the accident and should have factored it in the original price quote instead of hitting me with it a week after they sold me the policy This may have been legal but bad business in my opinion Please advise thank you

 When my husband and I both bought new in we were by that they offered a mechanical breakdown policy with a deductible We had purchased extended warranty's but since it was only a month for both we agreed Fast forward to today My truck is now years old The year extended warranty is now expired even though I only have miles on my truck My truck starts to have some issues I drop it off at the repair shop with the list of things to check and my info Two hours later I a call from Eric with the service department We go over the list of repairs Then he tells me that the deductible is per system So the check engine light is deductible The steering issue is The transmission leak they found that I knew nothing about is and the electrical is What the ** After much talk I am basically out of luck They have reduced it down to deductibles and I am not the electrical fixed Guess what I need a horn or daytime running lights I am canceling my policy and moving to someone else The only reason we kept this policy despite the price was the warranty We have been mislead and had I have lodged a complaint but I know it do me no good  
 I am so disappointed at My boyfriend's was sideswiped while parked in front of my house and because I was not insured and was a witness to the accident cancelled his policy claiming my information was not provided I not only spoke to his representative the day of the incident but also scanned and emailed over the police report with all of my information name address driver license number date of birth Because does not communicate between their departments his policy was cancelled due to   not providing my information   This is honestly the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard disgusting Oh let me state that I even own a nor do I drive in NY Why would I need is stating that I should have been insured  
Who do you know that charge you making a left turn while you turning right Who listen when you explain it over and over to them Who cover the damage to your even when you prove it was the other drivers fault Who wants your money but provides no help Who's to be there when you need help Not 
 My wife was to work when a woman ran a red light in front of her The woman was given a ticket after witnesses the police what happened She had called us right away and sent an adjuster who they would pay for our A month later no check so I called I was curtly they could take as long as they wanted to settle I filed a small claims suit but the judge clearly knew the attorney and dismissed my case I wrote the commissioner for the state of VA and they wrote back that they handle these kinds of issues I complained to my representative senator and the governor and no response They all re elected You wonder why pay  
 We were hit by a driver insured by We were never not to drive the and it took a while for them to him to admit his fault even though he was written a ticket by the police did pay for the damage and medical quickly but does not want to reimburse us for all the coolant we had to put in the in order to drive it Until they finally arranged for a rental and had the radiator damage accessed they are trying to say we should have driven it It was our responsibility to not drive it but we had no other form of transportation and the accident was not our fault imbecile supervisor tried to tell us our should cover the rental when we do not have full coverage and we were not at fault The medical claims lady then violated HEPA law and paid a doctor bill we never saw she called the doctor's office without our consent and the bill without our consent either We feel we should be paid for the coolant we had to use or we would have had loss use of the and could not work go to church go shopping or any other appointment folks are not the nicest The claims adjuster who looked at the was the only nice one but we felt that due to the internal damage the should have been totaled But then again we accepted his offer in an attempt to be reasonable We had an offer to sell the but that was before the cooling system damage occurred  
 About two months ago I was hit by of insured drivers while riding my bicycle down the street on which I live Not only did the crash total my bicycle and thus relieve me of my only means of transportation but it also obviously injured me The crash occurred when I while traveling northbound on the street a residential street mind you was turned into by a man traveling southbound who had neglected to use his blinker I was in a well lit area directly beneath a street light in fact wearing a bright white jacket and equipped with a red flashing light on my bicycle

  has the rudest customer service ever dealt with in my entire life After being treated poorly by an adjuster I called back to speak with her boss When he returned my call he was a sneering condescending senseless prick I even give them star wait to lose them  
 I carelessly paid for an unknown so called   pass bill   to a Auto representative The initial call was to an auto quote and the ramification of the call was unsuccessful and I was still left with no After calling my bank the rep informed me it take a long process to put a freeze on the account and he me to call back and explain to them what occurred and ask them to refund my money So I called again and spoke to Paula She informed me of a non payment in which I clearly understand so I asked her if she send me an invoice of the charges that accrued on an old account from   Sure   she Later she me her colleague send me that email since her computer is not allowing her to do so This is the funny part The incoming mail says ** Brian email address is ** with subject name Statement Now when you open an advertisement sales deals closeout for Big Lots I shop at Big Lots a great store but no rocket scientist and that is nowhere near a bill invoice Paula asked me several times if I received the email and I hadn't until we ended the call I want the amount back into my account and I know your fee to help me is more than the amount spent but that is fraud and consumers like me be victimized by greedy companies Stop me if I am wrong a big company with all their high tech computer programs and systems with vital information on them were incompetent in producing a well organized invoice statement but was only able to send a blog advertisement page promoting Big Lots Close out sale Yes that email explained everything  
 Recently I have become separated from my wife I tried removing her from being a driver but couldn't instead gave her my policy which I had before we were married Then they proceeded to give me a new policy and required that I pay for it all I still had months on the old policy of coverage for my and now they are refunding her the money I believe is a sexist company They give the benefit of the doubt to the person who originally set up the account and paid for it This is absurd I be switching to company but they probably do the same thing to me if this exact situation was to arise again  
 is the worst company I have ever used I never use their service again The are very unfair They happily insure anyone until you into an accident then they want to triple your without any warning whether it is your fault or not I never go back 
 I have full coverage and my was totaled by a person driving with a suspended license no registration or inspection and instead of fighting for me with Farmers they found me at fault because there was a stop sign present where I was located but I stopped and proceeded to turn when this crazy driver came out of nowhere and struck my driver side door This man even belong behind the wheel and instead of making an example of him who by the way has a history of doing this they make me pay for it all How is this even legal I have to continue paying off my that is totaled and do not have a I am afraid to drive now because he hit me so hard my seat even broke and i saw my life flash before my eyes  
 I was in an automobile accident Unfortunately I did not have a choice but to file the claim through    Auto Express Service    I was directed by the claim representative that it was guaranteed that the would be done within eight days because of their   express   policy I had to a rental and the is a newer Dodge Charger Having been in an accident and yes I am aware I am covered under I personally was afraid not to purchase the The only that they had at the Enterprise rental was a brand new Dodge Charger After agreeing to purchase this rental under the assumption that it would only take eight days I was directed by claim's manager that my repairs would take up to days Everyone that I spoke to at me that they did not know who provided me with that information The manager indicated that it would be done in seven days Today is day As soon as I my back I am switching to a different This is a warning to anyone in a similar position Please be careful when you consider your options and how you base your decisions because certainly not have a problem misleading you  
  has taken a accident on a that is worth under and separated it into several claims each estimate for repair on each claim is under my deductible This makes it so my cost me more than its worth to fixed and pays nothing The adjuster Chris ** was rude and listen when I informed him this was accident I him I had spoken with a police officer and a CHP officer who recreated accidents and they agree this should be a single claim clearly is the worst I am a % disabled veteran and this is how they treat people I have learned my lesson Stay away if you are looking for coverage The worth the paper it is printed on They con you into full coverage on a that worth much and when you need to use it they find a way to not pay I hope someone learn from my hard knocks I lost about not including the waste in payments I made for  
 I am new USA and purchased a new I called for regardless my wife had st Century They suggested that our total amount would be USD but if I exclude your wife it be USD After consulting with my wife we went with an option to exclude my wife out with USD Now when I went to see my policy online today I was shocked to know that they charged me USD that to without any prior information I called up Customer care and they suggested that sorry for inconvenience and they cancel the policy and only charge us for the days we were covered I would like to complain here that is it that you sell your product with wrong information and then cancel it with charges on it  
  year customer two insured—no claims and no tickets Recently I was driving very slowly on a four lane major street A guy came tearing out of a service station to my right and was cutting across my two lanes to make an illegal left hand turn and ran in to the front of my determined that I was % at fault Oh yeah it was raining and dark I was about miles per hour when I was hit I take my measly “settlement” and find company could have left me fully satisfied by paying the full loss—just over what they paid But they chose to screw me instead Lost a customer of long standing who is paying them almost a year in premiums so they could “save” themselves ** Might as well a second or third tier insurer since sucks so bad Their adjustors sound like robots on the phone  
 My was hit while legally parked on my street on September Because the owner of the was not driving she did not want to pay for the damage to my Thank goodness I have surveillance on my home as I knew who hit my She left no information Went to a local Auto Body shop and received an estimate in the amount of After two month of back and forth decides to pay for the damage I go for my appointment for their adjustor who informs me they not be paying for the entire bumper to be paint the section she hit They only pay for the damaged area to be painted As I am arguing with the adjustor named Kevin he says in front of his co workers and client   If you plan to cash out on this you won't    His supervisor and friends think this is good customer service How dare they let him speak to me like that My is a direct repair with the Auto Body shop I went to  
 I have had for over years I never missed a payment never had a ticket and never made a claim A year ago my bike was totaled by a hit and run driver and cover it took them over a year to tell me because they have any information on the guy that hit me Say what It was a hit and run why I pay for the extra uninsured policy My bike was totaled and they pay me a dime Way to reward a long term formerly loyal customer I waited a year with a wrecked motorcycle in my yard only to be tough ** Now I have a totaled bike and absolutely no recourse  
 Today at pm in the hazy Pacific Northwest dark a small red pickup cut me off and then immediately slammed on his brakes I rear ended him and before I could even my bearings the driver pulled forward turned left onto the next street and took off I tried to follow but he was driving on a residential street and my was badly damaged so I pulled into a parking lot and called the police and I was by that my account was now   flagged   and that I would be treated   as if I have coverage   until an investigator looks into things I for the life of me understand how they deny me coverage when I have full coverage on my Hyundai Sonata I checked online and my payment was processed on the nd So I am stranded freezing the cops find the driver and there is no towing no rental nothing How they do this I am finding a new company tomorrow and calling an attorney  
 After paying my premiums on and home for more than years and never filing a claim I a letter from Travelers terminating my home policy They had cashed my premium check a few months ago This 'letter' had no signature no address no phone number and no email in other words no way to an explanation or seek recourse  
 I recently was involved in an accident caused by a insured by The was driven by someone other than the people who insured the The entered the highway directly into my path When the police arrived they immediately handcuffed and arrested the driver of the He did not have a license and was an illegal Despite my statement and the police report clearly stating the driver was at fault denied the claim because they I should have had time to avoid this accident The driver admitted this accident was his fault on the police report I guess makes their own rules They apparently care who drives their insured licensed or not legal or not This experience is consistent with the horrible stories I have heard about my whole life  
  charges a installment fee per transaction for their auto policy If you pay your policy in installments Over the year If you are a long term customer that could be well over during the course of your patronage This fee is absurd and abusive And does little to ensure that their clients are aware they are paying a fee per transaction No company charges to process a payment Meanwhile claims this fee is assessed to cover the cost of billing and payment processing I only hope they pay their processors very very well to justify such fees We should all hammer on as banks are being hammered for charging debit card fees The racket is up  
 Recently I filed a claim because my was broken into and items including my stereo were stolen My claim was   denied   because says that the information my boyfriend and I submitted was inconsistent with the local liquor store hours and the sequence of events Additionally they that I was a red flag because I had recently reinstated my and changed my policy There was a gap that I aware of And then when I realized it I called immediately and made changes including canceling roadside assistance as I have AAA and Rental Reimbursement I also lowered my deductibles All of these changes were encouraged by the agent and actually lowered my rates as I have no previous issues and a perfect driving record  
 Paying online to is a joke Their rates were almost twice of the lowest quote They ask for every piece of private information and anyone in their company could fleece you If you make payments you have to sign up for auto pay period You know what drive down the street and it Nice try  
 I purchased a policy with last week I canceled it the same day because I found a more reasonable quote from carrier I only had coverage with for a day I was more than willing to pay it for that day's coverage and whatever fees accumulated for processing a policy They sent the transaction to my bank which I didn’t understand But I accepted it because maybe I called after a cut off period or something Fine I couldn’t understand for the life of me why once the first electronic payment was stopped and why there was a second debit in my account from To make things worst the second transaction did not appear until a Saturday morning while I was on vacation in Las Vegas When I called to inform them what has happened a sales rep instructed me to fax a copy of a bank statement showing the second debit to my account She that she'll take care of it plus any overdraft fees if applicable The very next day while on vacation I woke up bright and early to follow through with the instructions given to me I found out hours later from a supervisor that nothing do for it was the weekend Second accounts receivable who issue refunds and they would most likely not issue a refund if the policy was active They were basically telling me to wait until the check clears or gets rejected and pay any fees they accumulated for me or wait until Monday to speak with someone in AR and wait probably a week or so for a refund to be issued I have never in my life dealt with a company who have no customer service skilled employees or employees who cannot help customers in time of need Luckily I kept looking at carriers after I went to because this would have not been a happy beginning to a relationship between and I glad elsewhere now And if I ever need to change insurances again I know now after reading the rest of the reviews to skip right on by  
 On a Wednesday at PM the power steering belt broke on my in a remote area in the county I called for a tow The adviser was very friendly but could not a tow truck to rescue me I suggested a non participating tow company She called them and they were there in minutes the good part The bad part is that I had to pay the tow company out of pocket Maybe my back from and maybe not My was delivered to the repair shop After they fixed my power steering problem the repair shop   Your steering wheel seems a little bit loose    I in the and sure enough you could move the steering wheel    to the left and right and    up and down I the repair shop   I drive this been damaged    Later in the day they   Your steering column has been broken and it take over to fix it    I had no choice but to have it repaired Right away I called to report my being damaged either by the tow company or the repair shop Since I had a rental rider on my policy I asked for that service It was denied I   Suppose my was damaged on the highway As a result my steering column was broken thus rendering my immobile would you leave me stranded for weeks without a rental    She had no answer to that question She   In this case a adjuster determine whether you a rental or not  
 Due to the ice storm and then the subsequent hail storm has decided to cancel my multi policy that I have had with for about years I have submitted a complaint to the Department of Commerce and regarding their improper cancellation because they had to pay out on a claim I have to try and obtain new policy for four drivers in the household of which is on active duty in the U S Army within a very short period and with very limited funds I believe the people of Tennessee are being penalized because of weather related claims from January to April This is disgraceful and and others should be penalized severely  
 Our company was involved with someone who had with This accident happened in April and we still received all the reimbursement for the damages Instead of paying the shop for repairs or rental units they had us pay and then submit to them This to me is totally wrong What if we have the funds to pay up front I am still trying to payment for some charges which they have had copies of since April and instead of paying us for the actual repair bill they paid the estimate thing is for sure I not ever change my to after this experience  
 My minor child aged was a passenger and victim in a rear end collision in Houston Texas while sitting at a stop sign Police was called and an yr old boy admitted to the police that he was looking at the lake when he struck from behind The insurer is My daughter sustained major whiplash and was seen by a chiropractor for months So did the driver Jacalyn ** of the Claims dept me straight up my daughter was nothing because she was not hurt did however replace the entire bumper on the van because it was destroyed I hired Loancar & Associates after months of ignoring me To my shock Loancar did the same thing They took the case right away but never called me After several months Loancar    pay and it' s not worth their time as far as money is concerned   I dropped Loancar called and they made me deal with Jacalyn again They even refused to pay the total doctor bill of How does this happen How is it that an attorney even an company to pay I know where to turn I owe to my daughter's chiropractor She still suffers from shoulder pain now and then She went through alot of pain for about six months She had major whiplash documented by her doctor they settle this for which does cover the doctor bill and leaves nothing for my child I think I need a whiplash attorney who only collect if I collect  
 On October th I cancelled my automatic payment withdrawal which comes out of my bank on the th of each month It was a lengthy conversation minutes or so I wanted to away from Wells Fargo However withdrawal still happened It caused me to bounce the last outstanding checks I had I called and learned that they have no record of my call to cancel autopay They wanted me to provide a day bank statement and cell phone statement showing call to and the duration I do it because not giving some employee days of my personal spending habits to review So eat in overdraft charges returned check fees from Wells If they return checks to Publix eat in returned check fees  
 On Sunday October my was struck by a hit and run driver It was barely drivable probably not legally safe to be on road I reported the incident immediately to Four days later they are saying that it be next Monday before an adjuster even look at my Over a week to have an adjuster look at a that is not drivable In the meantime paying out of pocket for a rental because pay for anything until an adjuster signs off on the damage This is the worst service in my years of driving  
 Four months ago I called the number to a quote and see if I insured at the moment Of course they   yes    to everything and me the following First that I be insured the same day Second that it be the same price if I split it in monthly payments or pay all at once I specifically ask for this and Third that no problem with my record and there be any extra charges of any kind because he checked and everything be by e mail I printed the card the payments and everything online No need to waste paper  
 I have a flood policy that I obtained through you which was then serviced by travelers However I paid services everything about the policy except the enforcement of it A year ago I tried to out of forced placed flood from Bank of America A three way call was made and you me that I could lower my contents coverage after I you that it was a rd floor condo You sales rep then asked me if I had a basement and water heater furnace etc I replied yes I was that this would be covered in the event of a flood and that I should keep it BOA still on the phone that they needed to protect their investment in case of a flood and would not let me cancel the policy Both BOA and myself believed we were covered in the event of a flood I have contents and also building structure coverage Well there has been a flood All the essential covered components in the policy are ruined and for some reason not being covered My utilities and the building and structure have been damaged How is this possible You cannot mislead people like this I called yesterday and was by a flood rep that he has no ability to tell me about my policy I bought it from you I There is no problem in receiving my check is there You service the policy as my agent You need to treat your customers better I have every with you and this has strongly made me consider finding a better carrier I am contacting Consumer Affairs and the BBB next The point of this is that we have purchased a policy for protection that led us and the bank to believe Even when we tried to cancel we were assured we would be covered Now when it comes time for a claim I am being that the building structure is not covered I asked where does it state this in the policy and there is no answer Someone is interpreting my policy incorrect  
  stinks I never recommend them to anybody Originally I signed a new policy with in August and I was happy to have a good policy at a decent rate Since I to pay for the whole year up front they me I had to sign up for automatic debits from my checking account okay fine However I them that I wanted the down payment with account and all future payments with account They that was fine but they totally screwed that up They charged the wrong bank account the next month This caused my account to be overdrawn and checks to bounced which caused me to pay almost in fees When I called and them about it they would not accept any responsibility or whatsoever let alone reimburse me for the fees I want an company that is arrogant that not admit they made a mistake and not do anything to fix it I never recommend to anybody I cancelled my policy the very next day and urge all of you to do the same an company that you trust not  
 My a Mazda CX has been insured with since May when I purchased the To insure the I provided the VIN and model year I found out recently that they have my down as a Because of this they have been charging me more in premiums to insure a newer when I had a Mazda that was model year older I asked for a refund of the overcharged amount from the first day of it was company policy that they provide me a refund for only the past months I believe that because of their sloppy data management they had the wrong information on my and that they wrongly overcharged me I escalated my request to a supervisor and I was that there is nothing that they do I would like to know what other recourse I may have to recover my money  
 My was involved in a hit by a U Haul truck I immediately called and followed their directions exactly I retrieved the police report called with the information contacted the other person's company and et cetera Apparently the information on the police report was incorrect and I was that my claims representative would research the correct information for U Haul and return my call I called several times because I did not receive any return calls from Finally I decided to do the research myself I searched U Haul headquarters and their information through Google Now would think an company especially as large as could certainly find out who U Haul is insured by quicker than I can It quickly became apparent to me that I needed to file a claim through because twelve days had passed and no had even looked at my to estimate the repairs Once filed through it took several calls to the towed from the tow yard Once again it was of communication and negligence which led to me making several calls to someone from to tow it week later still cannot the information for U Haul Truck Company I called to give them the information I had on U Haul which was names contact information a claim number and an adjuster Two days later they had no record of that information in their computers and I was being advised that I was nearing the end of my rental coverage and that I would need to pay the remaining five days out of pocket I was also that I could submit for reimbursement from U Haul In the meantime be using the contact information that I researched on my dime to seek reimbursement for their expenses I would think the least and most practical thing to do would be to pay the remaining five days on my rental and seek reimbursement for everything at once When I called to speak to a supervisor I was   We work as a team and anyone help you ” The problem is no is helping me The customer service is terrible there is no follow through and there is a dangerous lack of communication however assigned someone to see that your case gets taken care of paperwork is filed etcetera but you cannot actually   speak   to this person because they have no direct extension or contact information What good is this person's job if they cannot be held accountable for what they are supposed to do This is a disgrace and I highly advise anyone considering to avoid them at all costs Your percent savings is tacked on to   the back end   by cutting corners poor service and an overall lack of morals  
 On September th my FX Infiniti was struck while parked in a handicap parking spot at a Friday's Restaurant inside The Woodlands Mall by a young lady who after inside her turned the music of her to where it could be heard from outside with her windows up Her was a Chrysler Charger with tinted windows She backed up and hit ours damaging our rear fender My brother sitting in his wheelchair was next to our and I was escorting my girlfriend to her in the parking lot while all of these happened The year old woman out of the and after she saw that she had hit us handwrote her information Name Policy Number Father's name expiration date on a piece of paper and asked that we call her the next day My father called her the next day and she accepted responsibility but only offered to pay or for the damages to our rear fender My father went to the Infiniti and an estimate worth as the rear bumper has to be replaced My father called her and she him that she could not afford that amount and him that she would call and submit the claim which she never did After a few days we decided to call and provide this young lady's information and we submitted our claim When called her she denied striking our  
 i was hit by who has I have been unable to contact them by phone It seems like they have contracted with www numsvc com who wants to charge to a phone number to be able to report a claim After reading several of the comments about it only makes sense that they are acting like of the   offshore   companies from the ' 's & ' 's you know the ones that take your money for   insurance   but never be there when you need them  
 On I called to request a quote for Home Owners since I already had an auto policy through them I them I was calling to prices As it turns out my NJM who I had my current Home Owner policy through gave me a better price for both the Home Owners and the auto So I canceled my auto with A couple of weeks later I received a bill for Home Owners from who had   sold   the policy to Narragansett Bay Company I called and spoke to Dan ** He had me sign a cancellation form even though I never signed for a policy and asked me to fax email it to him I asked why I had to do this and he stated   that the computer program messes up and when they hit a button it orders the policy And that if I cancel the policy it would be held against me for reasons   So I faxed the form A couple of weeks later I received bill along with a registered letter which I refused to pick up I called again and spoke with James ** He gave me the same song and dance and wanted to send me the form again have me fill it out and send it to them again I located a copy of the original cancellation policy and forwarded that to him I received an email stating that   it had never been signed   and could I do it again Really All this work because of a computer glitch It seems like a scam to me I have all the original emails and gladly forward them to you At this point not sending them anything else Question Is there really anything I be held liable for  
 My wife Dana ** was in an accident involving her and The other she rear ended when it stopped abruptly to turn into a place of business The damage done to her was to the front and front right of her In we called to file a claim and they sent us to Richard ** Auto Damage Claims Adjuster on ** From the time of the accident to the in we were saving up for our deductible Upon dropping the off we were informed that we have to pay until the completion of repairs The initial bid for repairs was never seen by either me or Dana After work was already started on the Chevy Malibu we found out what the total estimate price was We immediately started to question and call the collision center and adjuster looking for a reason to be spending over dollars on our We brought up the question of what our was worth and why we were fixing it instead of totaling it All they us was that they were fixing the and it would be done on the th of August They still have no answer for us on what our was worth and should we be totaling it or not The initial research from Kelley Blue Book revealed our is worth in fair condition and in good condition And by definition it would be a stretch to classify the Malibu in good condition It took an excess of three weeks to fix the damages on her Malibu where Dana had to call and try to extend our rental coverage due to a lengthened time of completion of repairs The Collision Center's communication was awful After numerous attempts of Dana asking to call her she is the only handling these issues and I am still messages that she did not receive anything from the Collision Center of America Dana did try to pick up the and there were issues with the Collision Center when she found out that they the rental place that our was already picked up On occasion of the personnel of the Collision Center harassed Dana about her communication skills with me that person   We left messages with your husband maybe you need to work on your marriage and communication skills    The number of calls was placed to in regards to the rental being covered for the extended period of working time on Malibu The rental was to be covered due to us having no control of our being worked on or the drama to ensue due to lack of quality workmanship on the Malibu August th th and th we called the Collision Center but they did not return our call On August th Dan from Enterprise called back and   Your was picked up why do you still have the rental    On August th JT from Collision Center called around AM he that the rental be squared up due to the miscommunication on their part On September rd I called the Collision Center but did not return my call again On September th Jeffry ** called and that everything be taken care of When Dana finally picked up her Chevy Malibu she was exhausted from trying to proper and fair treatment she drove home realizing her was unsafe For starters the power locks work anymore The oil was never changed or filled up to the proper level with an oil indicator light on the display There was even a dent still in the front right quarter panel which I believe should have been fixed Worst of all she me her breaks were still making noise Once again she is back on the phone with the Collision Center explaining that her was not fixed to satisfactory They sent a tow truck out to pick up the The Collision Center would not return or cover rental even though it was their job to return us a safe and completely fixed Malibu Dana is a plain housewife with kids in school and no means of transportation She called a supervisor Jeffery ** Sept th and tried to complain and find somebody who could to the bottom of why a fixed through is such a hassle They that they would check into it and let us know After the first day the was brought back and we heard from the Collision Center They stated that they fixed the according to what went wrong in the crash and that was it They the dent was there it was fine that the power locks work and that our breaks were our responsibility Knowing this they also gave us a final sheet from NADA telling us our was worth This was the Clean Retail Value of the Malibu To reinstate the definition of Clean Retail Value as it is stated in their printout Clean Retail Values reflect a in clean condition This means a with no mechanical defects and passes all necessary inspections with ease Paint body and wheels have minor surface scratching with a high gloss finish and shine Interior reflects minimal soiling and wear with all equipment in complete working order has clean title history This definition clearly is not what shape the Chevy Malibu is in The seats and interior is soiled where a professional cleaning is needed and might not even clean the stains The fact that they knew and refused to fix the breaks leaves the in poor mechanical driving condition All interior equipment is in poor working conditions Leaving power locks not working the CD player work leaving only a radio And most important this is the Malibus second major accident CarMax even noticed clamp marks and frame damage on the when I brought in for an appraisal In addition to their price sheet being for a in excellent condition Collision Centers added every option they could think of to make the Malibu look like it was worth more You see on the NADA price sheet all the options listed highlighted and checked in orange what the Chevy Malibu is actually equipped with The bids estimates and values listed in this complaint are attached following the letter To conclude this I would like to express how upset Dana and I are with this whole claim Dealing with and the Collision Centers of America was a fiasco We were run around playing phone tag with multiple different representatives as we were both called simultaneously being condescending information about the damages and repairs being done And at the end of it all it was us trying to tell you we were unhappy with the service they are telling us   We fixed your now come and it    We paid the deductable of to our back We spent the needed dollars of brake parts and three hours of my time in labor went in as well I have photos that show you what the Collision Center never really looked at We then took the Chevy Malibu straight to CarMax for an appraisal to find that it was worth to us We are no dealership who is to a Clean Retail Value for a Even the Kelley Blue Book prices in fair to good condition still do not meet the expenses to fix the And as the final low blow all the talk about us being taken care of with a rental during this whole ordeal was a smoke screen as we received a bill from Enterprise for dollars on September th All together this is the worst experience ever had from an company auto repair shop and rental facility that seem to be working side by side to make this happen Bravo We would like to see a refund for our deductibles our Enterprise bill taken off our names as not our fault it took an extended amount of time to fix our I would like a written apology to my wife from the Collision Center for making personal comments about her life which pretty sure is against the law or business policy And mostly I would like the personnel involved to be investigated for their business ethics and claims decisions Our Malibu should have been totaled from the beginning and none of this would have happened I feel somebody was trying to make a dollar or making sure their business had something to work on and our was their opportunity I feel used and cheated out of a proper claim In final addition before sending this complaint my wife Dana had her over heat while driving on the highway for the first time since the repairs The radiator was inspected and supposedly worked on by the Collision Center in the repairs invoice Yet problem with the after receiving a completed product out of the Collision Centers of America shop It is not the owner's job to double check every fluid and piece of mechanics on their right after they it from a shop who us that it was complete and in Clean Retail Value All in all found nothing clean about their work their customer service their communication skills and their overall responsibility to be moral and ethical in the work they do  
 Rochelle ** falsely quoted prices to sell policies Four days after I paid for the policies which was a day after the policies went into effect Rochelle called to tell me that she has   assumed   the prices Since she   assumed   incorrectly I am stuck paying higher premiums which I never would have purchased  
 My was hit by a driver that has a I was not in the I was not even in town To the driver's credit he did contact my relatives who owned the house where my was parked in front of He asked me to a quote I went to Service King and asked them to do high end and low end quotes Service King initially stated that even on the low end my may be totalled because of the extent of the damage The Service King repair guy explained to me in detail that the extent of the damage is unknown and the quote may be more because he cannot see what damage is under the panel which would need to be removed I give the quote to the guy and he then files the claim Apparently uses Service King but not that particular branch of Service King So I took the to place on the other side of town I was minutes late to my initial appointment I lost and the adjuster cancelled my appointment and me I needed to reschedule he was sitting at his desk doing nothing I called and ranted and raved and appointment that same day but in Service King I went on the other side of town and took the for the adjustment with the adjuster and her quote is considerably less than the initial quote difference I figured it would be lower but that bothered me and made me feel as though not a fair quote I was that there may be additional damage but I only an appraisal for that if I allow them to do the repair I feel it is only fair that I am given all of the information available to me before deciding how to proceed Is there a way to an unbiased opinion I am a bit upset with this process I want to over I want what is fair  
 I called in a payment on August for to be deducted from my checking account and recited my account number to the representative On August I had a minor accident and called in the claim to which later that day informed me that my auto had been cancelled I called my bank and the funds were still in my account After much research I found out that the representative that took my payment over the phone on the th selected an old account line to an old debit card that was used years ago And that is why my coverage was cancelled I contacted again and requested that they review the recording of my payment because I am positive I selected a payment from my checking account which I do every month and the representative always make you recite the account number to them never back to me about the recording and I also expressed to them to check the history of my account which also show how I always pay with my checking account They never responded about the recording and then I received a letter on August saying they are denying my claim and any liability This is more than unfair when their representative clearly made a huge error by selecting the incorrect account And I was not notified that my policy was cancelled And now I am stuck with damage to my and they are not taking responsibility for an error that they made I have been with for many years now and this behavior is unfair and I believe a bit fraudulent  
 On Sunday I called for the supposedly   free   roadside service They were so unprofessional the first two times I called Finally they someone out to me on the turnpike The reps continued to ask me for a physical location I did not have one there are no mile markers and I was not out on foot to try to find signs Consequently I was given a call three days later from the underwriting dept The young lady sounded rather rude and abrupt in her voice message I returned the phone call to be that my roadside coverage would be cancelled due to me using it six times fro the year This is an absolute lie I asked where do I file a complaint and I was I could write a letter is totally out of order Apparently they think they have a monopoly on Buyers beware is not what it seems  
 I had a wreck and had me tow my Honda CRV into D'Patrick Collision Center They emailed me an estimate to fix it and I waited to hear from my agent Two days later I had called her and she that my was almost fixed I give them the approval to fix it but I let it go I was very upset that they my approval and now having issues with the AC I know the problem was done at the collision center but that they did nothing to the AC I had a new put in three and a half years ago and when I took it back to have it checked they me that it had two times the freon in it and they took half of it out the only way it could had gotten freon in it was when they were doing the repairs Now my compressor is burned up and they are telling me that they not pay to have a new put in I could have really fought the issue when they fixed my without my approval but I and now they are not making it right They say that there is no proof that there was any work done on the AC but it has always worked great and I have never had it in the shop for any repairs so it had to be done when they fixed my without my approval If I had been given the choice I would have gotten opinion on fixing my wrecked CRV before deciding where to have it fixed and they may have seen the AC was damaged but I given that choice  
 I filed my no fault claim with my company because I want to deal with our company commercial situation sent me to of their preferred repair facility My came back with additional damages Then when I called them they me that the scratches were already there and that the picture the body shop took was at a bad angle Then they broke a part on the inside of the They me normal wear and tear I wait for this claim to be closed because done with them After years I treated like a step child

 On August my street flooded due to intense rainstorms My was parked in front of my home and was submerged in a high level of water and on the interior it was above the seats to give you a visual idea of the damage My adjuster claimed that the was not totaled after first inspecting the and issued a payment of to me Even someone who a expert knows that this amount of money do nothing except the seating replaced and carpets shampooed Every person on my block who was parked on the street when the flooding occurred had total losses declared by their respective companies so it like I am the only this happened to I had the towed to a mechanic a couple of days later The mechanic tells me that the is definitely totaled because of the damage along with future problems that could occur with the The mechanic me that they would contact my adjuster and send in the supplement form to to move forward After over a week of me calling both and the mechanic everyday in order to be proactive I finally had to contact a senior adjuster to complain because the mechanic that he kept contacting my adjuster with no response whatsoever The adjuster claims that no ever called him which I know is not the case Why would the mechanic lie to me I was calling them everyday and being a royal pain Finally two days after I had called the senior adjuster and the was declared a total loss I called customer service in their claims department to find out the status of my claim and they that it had not yet been declared a total loss A hurricane hit us folks in New York so is inundated with claims and says that they extend my day rental policy coverage I call everyday and everyone at points fingers at in different departments is the party that is dragging this out and there is nothing I do I soon not only be left without a at all but no settlement check to buy a new I now have an attorney and I may have to take action against I am married in two weeks and then leaving the country for a week so if this is not handled by next week I then be gone for a period of two weeks I even that I am reasonable and I care how long this process takes as long as they cover me on a rental for the duration of that time I am compassionate and I understand that they are overloaded with claims because of the natural disaster that has happened I may now have to take legal action against because I feel that they are liable for this negligence not only in relation to the time frame but the quality of the adjuster's assessment of my I have no other options at this point If anyone else has a similar situation to mine please contact me and maybe together we fight against this Thank you  
 On I was rear ended by driver who's running mph After two independent MRI services it was confirmed that I had cervical herniated disc with cervical radiculopathy and herniated lumbar disc I attempted to rehab myself without the need for surgical intervention After about months physician determined that I required additional medical treatment refused to pay any of my claim for lost wages after that point Four months later I was seen by physician who stated that I did not require any treatment beyond days after the accident This wholeheartedly refutes what the first physician At that time stopped paying any benefits for my claim for first party benefits Med Wages Nurse Attn Care To date physical therapy has not resolved my injuries and refuses to pay for the spinal surgery that I need to resume a normal life and return to gainful employment On rejected an arbitration award of to bring my claim current They made a counteroffer of if I agree to make no further future claims regarding this loss This is ludicrous given that Michigan No Fault Law allow lifetime medical treatment and wage loss benefits for three years following the loss I have been awarded Social Security Disability SSDI benefits but still refuses to pay their portion of my claim for lost wages disability nor allowed coverage for any further medical treatment  
 I am currently involved in a claim where a customer caused a collision of three mine being of them tried to me to consent to being responsible for anything above a day for my rental Their adjuster Joe called me today and that they were to use   aftermarket   parts to repair my I bought my brand new It had no aftermarket parts on it when their client decided to destroy it Now that I am complaining and have contacted Chevrolet no seems to be able to answer their telephones or voice mail messages  
 This is my resignation from affiliate Life Quotes Per our conversation I want to restate my opinion of your appalling business tactics Let me first summarize my complaints You stated in your advertisement for the sales position that it pays ' per hour' This is completely misleading The real pay is ' hour of talk time' of which on any given shift an agent is working 'talk time' is usually only half of the time worked For example if I work an eight hour shift of which I must be logged in the computer for eight hours I on average only be 'talking' approximately four hours of which I receive hour So the real pay is approximately hour Why do you not advertise the position stating this fact Are you hiding this very important fact Is this a bait and switch tactic In addition to receive the ' hour of talk time' an agent must also achieve three different 'ratios' submissions ratio talk time ratio issued ratios Now if only of these 'ratios' are not met an agent does not receive his or her ' of talk time' or any commissions earned This is not clear in the contract and was not clearly communicated to me before I signed up For example an agent work a two week shift work hours on average sell 'X' amount of policies and receive at the end of the pay period This is completely absurd How you expect people to work for two weeks then find out at the end of the two weeks that they not receive anything Why is this very critical point not emphasized in the contract And why was this not clearly communicated to me Again are you trying to hide something Do you not think that knowing this fact would be a decisive factor for an agent considering the position I honestly say that had I known this I definitely would not have signed up and invested over In addition I had tried to address this issue and have email documentation with upper management including CEO Bob Bland and president Drew Gregory and my issues would not be directly addressed Each time the issue was diverted and I would not receive a direct answer affiliate Life Quotes is able to away with this because most agents like myself need to invest approximately to obtain various state licenses to start the program Obviously after investing such a large sum of money an agent is committed to the program although critical points of the pay plan stated above are not made aware to the agent until after the investment is made This puts the agent in an uncompromising position as you image I have wasted over month of work of which I have sold over in annual premium and wasted an investment of over due to your lack of transparency and unethical practices and now I have almost nothing to show for it I think your business practices are appalling and it is amazing to me that a reputable company like whom I personally have auto with would knowingly participate in the these unethical bait and switch business tactics Furthermore I would think the public would be as appalled especially under the current economic environment to learn that a household name company like would be involved in such practices I am sure that the Commissioner's Office of Maryland and Illinois would also be very interested in your business practices as well as the companies you represent such as Transamerica Genworth MetLife Lincoln Financial etc I would hope now that you would think it would only be fair and reasonable to reimburse me of my investment and commissions on all the policies I have written and sold of which I am the writing agent on and the per hour of the hours I have worked Further I suggest you change your job advertisements so no in the future would to go through the same ordeal  
  made an agreement on July to accept to stop a cancellation This is if I agreed to pay in August and monthly payments of thereafter But they did not specify when the was to be paid in August When I called about this I was the policy that I have had with them for years was cancelled because I did not make the payment on Aug And it was now Aug They were to send me a letter explaining the agreement and due date but I never it Furthermore there was no record of this agreement In order to have auto with them it would be a new policy and costs more a month I am looking for insurer

 They make mistakes on policies and you must call to change it They take calls never follow up and the bill is never corrected You complain to them and they pass it off like it does not matter My opinion after two years of being with them is they are there to take your money and that is where the buck stops It is a very deceptive company I am so glad to away from them  
 On July th I was rear ended by a driver mph who never even looked as he was hitting my truck in the rear He was too busy looking out at the water and did not notice that all traffic had stopped My company Pennsylvania National after two weeks paid for my totaled truck but so far has yet to email me back after speaking to four of their representatives None speak to me about broken fishing gear and medical problems I do not want to sue anyone to be made whole again Seems like which many have me after the accident is the absolute worse when dealing with folks who were hurt by their customer Shame on I even had to send them the police report since their investigators were either too lazy or the company was too cheap to their own copy Actually I had to fax it twice since their location is so disorganized they could not find the first copy which in fact was sent to the right number confirmed by my fax report I have over worth of validated cargo damage to very expensive fishing equipments a hurt leg and neck and they refuse to even call me or email me back I do not want to sue anyone I want my stuff paid for I have all the items broken and took pictures to confirm it all happened in the accident My truck was a Titan and was in excellent shape The money I received from my company was not enough to pay for an equal truck hence I now drive a Honda Fit is the worse company in the world and should be investigated by the commissioners in each state My dad always   son never judge a man by the manner in which he treats you but by the manner in which he treats others    you are the ** filled pimple located on the infested hair in the **l section of the industry I hope your rotten ** choke on all that money you rip from hard working people Shame all over you If you are insured by them you too are in for a real delight when the time comes to back up their words with actions Oh by the way that 'gecko' is actually a chameleon and who actually gives a rat's ** what nationality he is  
 I had a wreck on August th Afterwards I found out that I have been paying high premium amounts to then be I only have liability on all three Also they show on our policy a lienholder's name Which means they never contacted our lienholder as they should have This is normal procedure I know what to do Our is totaled and our not pay If anyone could give us some advice on what we could do it would be greatly appreciated

 I've never been in a accident and have never filed an claim I have years of high performance driver training along with advanced driver training from my current employer Needless to say a very good driver I had made an inquiry to about my coverage for a sanctioned and insured HPDE High Performance Drivers Education course at Watkins Glen Raceway A couple months later I received a letter that they had cancelled my for using my for racing I had naturally called to explain that an HPDE is a non timed educational course designed to improve control ultimately to improve on road driving ability They continued to accuse me of racing and being a high risk driver solely based on a phone inquiry that I made to determine my coverage Why did I call in the first place To determine if I needed supplemental track in case of an incident My complaint is they falsely with no evidence or record placed me into a high risk driving category Their logic was that because I attended High Performance Driving Schools I be inclined to race my on the street I explained to them that that is like saying because I drunk at home does not mean go out and drive drunk In either case they would not give me a legitimate reason for cancelling my Again I had always paid my bills had never had a claim and only had minor traffic violation for not obeying a traffic control device  
 I had a policy # ** with which expired on May Early in the year about January I asked a friend to contact on why my policy fee has increased After talking to he me that did not agree to lower the fee nor anything about any discount he did not take the name of the person whom he talked to He suggested that I shop for company So I searched for And in early April I obtained a policy from company for my with coverage beginning on May It was the day after the last day of the policy from In May started sending me letters asking me to provide them info about my husband I'm divorced and my policy was indicated as such insisting that my husband be included in my policy I felt weird They were greedy and aggressive with their request Thinking of some office records mix up they would correct themselves but they did nothing about it In the meantime I already new coverage for my and waited for the expiration of the old policy  
I am the claimant and I was struck by a man insured with while riding my bike on July th I received a phone call from an adjuster about three weeks ago I returned his phone call twice and I have not received a return phone call I am injured and I do not have health I called again today and apparently there is a dispute about who my adjuster is I want someone to help me obtain the necessary medical attention I need and to resolve this claim What would you suggest I do I am injured and I have not received medical attention and my bike is damaged 
 I specifically went with to save my % or more Not only did I not save money but I have no coverage at all I was broke down at a strange location and I worried because I had good right WRONG Then a few weeks later I found myself to have a broken windshield guess what was wrong again I am paying more for and I have none of the benefits I have always taken for granted with other companies that have provided me in the past I was very specific about physical damages to my but I have not received any benefits being a member as yet  
 On April my was damaged by a tornado Bradley ** was the adjuster on my claim After all his calculations he asked us to come in to discuss everything During the discussion I asked if   I could buy the back    He me no My wife and I were upset because it was a very good and it was almost paid for So we took what was offered to us after the pay off and went shopping The other day I found out in North Carolina that the law allows the consumer to be given the option to buy the back and a salvage title very upset when I found out about that because I asked if I could do so with my and was that was not possible like to know what be done now that my is probably at a junkyard and is being parted out  
 Would not give fair estimate on a totaled I wanted back and they wanted to drop off the salvaged price they did not want to pay me for the custom features on the truck but the wanted to charge me for them if I wanted the back The totaled the accendent was because of bad weather conditions I was driving under the speed limit but blamed me for the aacident All I want is a fair price and the truck back  
 We are been with for many years Last year on July we added a to our current and by phone we discuss all the different covers and we thought we were done We a months report with amount charged and coverage we are been so busy that we never check all the details about charges until today added to our Road service and Rental coverage that we never ask for so they are been charging us for months for this services that we never authorize Then I think well I call and they have to give me a refund or credit Wrong wrong I was They give no credit no refund because it was my responsibility for not read and check the report they send to me every months So be careful check your reports every time This is so wrong WHAT A SCAM Shopping for a new  
 Very Disappointed with appraisal for my NEW Acura RDX Damaged by hail & quoted price with After Market parts They estimated this year to be installed with After Market price When they overlooked broken side indicator mirror broken part when I requested to reconsider they reduce the labor hours and add the part item What If does like this they would be my last option Stay away from  
 They took a very long time to process me thru the system They were very rude approaching me with the service They made a whole lot of claims that were very untrue And the inflation was way too high I did not like the guy which whom I was speaking with And I very much so did not like the fact I was being overcharged Despite the fact that I was under the impression that the coverage plan was initially set out to be much lower than it really was It has not added and value in my life what so ever As a matter of fact their coverage was much more of a inconvenience and less likely to benefit my day to day situations Rude and innocuous sales representative Agents I spoke with is a even more of an turn off from their company's so called policies very glad I no longer am affiliated with this so called brand of insuring  
 I hit and made a claim It took them days to inform me that there was nothing they could do because of the size of the road even though it was on my package If you hit on a small road and you have a policy with this company they take six months and then give you the runaround and then tell you that they are sorry but there is nothing they do I found out that I cheaper than they could ever think about I a ticket for reckless years ago and they want over hundred dollars State Farm dollars and it was a better policy Stupid rude no clue how to do their job help who are not necessary for the job You would be better off talking to automatic  
 Overall this company is ok but it could have better customer service hard to anything done because they basically ignore you especially if looking to cancel Pretty cheap but a reason why This company lacks the essentials when dealing with customers Looking for a better company There is no customer service department unless signing up for They want you to do everything online a local agent nearby and he refuses to help you  
 Did not have to use claims processing as I did not have any claims I have heard others say they were satisfied though very prompt and comprehensive Offer a variety of coverage options from minimum coverage to very comprehensive coverage with a wide variety of deductibles Was very satisfied with their offering and felt that they had coverages to meet most people's needs The value it adds is mainly peace of mind that I not have to suffer a huge financial setback as I have never received any money back from them Customer service representatives were helpful over the phone but I had to contact them They are not proactive in contacting you I felt like it was somewhat of an impersonal experience  
Be careful if you are hit by an uninsured motorist They fight you other than look out for your best interest Your good driving record does not matter They are THE WORST OF THE WORST IN PROTECTING ITS CUSTOMERS They are a trojan horse company 
 Honestly I remember having to do a claim or anything that had to do with processing anything If there was something small like a ding in a windshield my husband would have taken care of that type of thing I no longer have a but am planning on very soon It had all options from full coverage to liability It all pricing and every different rates For people like us we were rate and another It was a bad value as they quoted price and ended up charging a lot more They basically gave us the runaround when we called to inquire what was the problem Bad we called to find out what the problem was with the billing and the runaround and it was a huge headache We had to drop them never again  
 It was relatively easy to find the service needed to decide whether to choose this service or not The coverage of your choice and to its benefits are relatively up to you The coverage of the listed is worth it to me overpriced for full or even liability The value seem decent but the overall value worth it to me because I currently pay cheaper for the same coverage and overall device The customer service is wonderful not the service of the actual provider The people are very kind to assist and help with quote  
 Claims personnel be rude and not understanding Had to have a claim reassigned several times until I received a claims person who actually called back and kept me updated First few reps were rude and very unfeeling has many options for different coverage but after being a customer military as well for years all I say is that they have become very expensive and only minimum options are at all affordable As a military widow I only afford the most basic coverage which is not enough to be comfortable used to be a great with great rates for military especially but it no longer is I have called several times to find out why my rate keeps more expensive for less coverage The customer service people usually put me on a lengthy hold then return with garbled explanations that make no sense In other words they keep raising rates for me  
 I left last June because they raised my premium every six months No accidents great credit score defensive driving safe Subaru Outback The month premium went from + to over in a matter of a couple of years I switched to Travelers at a substantial savings Today I a letter from telling me that now has a new way of setting premiums how much they miss me and I consider coming back Sure if Travelers starts to pull the same nonsense The only way to bring these grifters to heel is to play their own game Use them as long as they behave ethically and cut them loose when they start to pull their premium raising shenanigans  
 After speaking with a wonderful Customer Service Representative by the name of Whitney I was transferred to Calvin in new sales about a quote concerning purchasing a new policy for my year old daughter He was incredibly rude His tone was as if I was bothering him His customer service was absolutely horrible You would think that because I was possibly trying to add a to my policy or purchase policy which is more money that I be paying to the company that I would have been treated better Needless to say I am extremely disappointed  
 The man who hit me out of his &   did I hit you    I   what the hell YES   He he see me Distracted driver He had his license & card in hand I took pictures of the same Well as soon as it was safe to pull in a parking lot I called they opened a claim then   we have to verify with our customer   When I called them the next day they no contact with their insured They treated me like I was insane So far I feel like I to screwed I had them my even three months old a From reviews read an uphill battle  
 I had two with full collision and rental reimbursement coverage On then I reached the loan pay off point and removed collision for that I assumed I still had rental reimbursement coverage No I had an accident and now while I wait up to days for the other company to assume liability I have to pay out of pocket for a rental No bothered to tell me that the rental reimbursement policy only applies if you have collision Eventually I the money back but it is a hardship now to have to pay for it Which is why I wanted the coverage I knew this could happen thought I was covered and now find out no it is not covered They offered to cover it for five days as a concession Five days when it has already been days and could be more Not good  
 My driver side tire was flat then I call customer service to request a roadside assistance Everything was well until I discover that the tire was not well adjusted something that represented a real danger for my life and my family The Bolts were completely loose That explained the noise that originated from that side of the Thanks to my boss who noticed the problem nothing tragic happen But it is unacceptable that someone endangers the whole life of a family by not paying attention to something so simple I hope it never happen again and someone give me an explanation and an apology about this pitiful case  
 After being an insured driver under this company for more than years with no issues or complications it is disheartening to say I am so disappointed by the company After being I had to combine insurances with my fiancé they incorrectly entered my information then misinformed the DMV of my   lack of insurance   although I was still paying it and after I pulled over for bad plates they refuse to pay or even reimburse me for the charge Now is that good customer service I do not think so Is it my fault the employee incorrectly transferred over the information No Is it my fault they then sent that information to the DMV and had my registration ceased No Is it their responsibility to rectify this issue and simply reimburse me for this temporary permit I now have to due to their error YES However they are not to do that So after speaking with representatives who was extremely frustrating for her argumentative demeanor   Paulette   and the other who was able to quickly transfer me over to the supervisor who upon apologizing was still unwilling   unable to do anything about it   I have decided to change my after my policy is up Personally a company that is unwilling to admit fault and reimburse someone for an issue they caused is not the type of company I would like to stay with It says a lot about the company and their values I heard Progressive is pretty good anyone have any suggestions  
 I know if reps lie or what but every months when our policy ends the price gets higher and higher Every single rep has me that it is because Texas'   state   taxes rises First of all stop lying The state of Texas has no state tax so you people may stop your darn lies When all it really be is that prices from other companies go up so they want to go up too tell the truth Maybe my hubby and I agree to shop around for cheaper and a better price elsewhere and perhaps who lie to their faithful customers Also when they explain a policy to a customer try to slow it down a notch  
 I'm a auto policyholder for about years Recently I called to a quote on homeowner's policy The quote was higher than what I currently have with insurer so I the agent that think about it The agent informed me that this quote and related data be available for several weeks While running numbers the agent asked me who's my mortgage company I was surprised at the question and responded I wanted to a quote The agent assured me that it be activated without my expressed intention and if I call back the policy go into effect so there was no danger in providing info on the mortgage lender I did Shortly after I received a letter from congratulating me on signing up with a homeowner's Perturbed I called to see how this came about The agent me that because I called prior to the deadline that the new policy would have gone into effect it was no problem cancelling it So far so good However over the weekend I received a check for from for a refund Again bewildered I called back asking what's this about The agent informed me that funds were withdrawn from my escrow even though the policy was cancelled I asked why did I receive the check She responded that I need to deposit it and send a check to repay amount to the mortgage company I asked why do I need to these things if I sign up for homeowner's policy I wanted to a price quote The agent understood but she what happened She was courteous to offer to contact the lender forward documentation to them and make sure that homeowner's policy was really cancelled with the lender I her that I appreciate her doing that but I still have a check that needs to be taken care meaning I need to deposit and send a check to the lender Why should I be doing this if someone at was too zealous in signing me up for policy She apologized and offered to see if some kind of compensation be implemented on my auto policy for this unnecessary headache She returned on the phone and that unfortunately the manager have any compensation So even though happy with auto policy and cancel my existing policy peeved that required to take care of the check and related clerical duties for something that I ask for  
  was unable to set up an autopay via electronic check by Routing # & Checking Account # During of my attempts a customer representative even had the nerve to say why she bank with Chase Really I set up this new Checking account over a week ago and had successfully set up electronic payments with Verizon AAA Paypal Synchrony etc I was instructed to call Chase and to verify my information Then I was instructed to call Forte Payment Systems to check with them and it turns out entered my last name as ** and that is incorrect my last name starts with an ** At this point I figured everything should work now NOPE   Sorry we facilitate an automatic payment via Routing # & Checking #      I refuse to use my Credit Cards Debit Cards for my own personnel financial etiquette I had to settle with using my debit card I try at a later time to switch the payment to Routing and Checking in the future If they still cannot facilitate the automatic payment via Routing and Checking I take my business elsewhere  
 When I change my state from NJ to FL – price went up by % not fair They did not disclose share the information in a proper manner I think I have full rights to know that I was having property damage liability of They keep on charging me high cost and when I am having a fair discussion to reduce the price needed because price was so high and difficult for me to pay as I bought a new and wanted to keep the old as well and at least bench mark the price what I am from other provider they me   Go ahead    And by the time they reveal property damage liability at LexisNexis right away each provider do a check whether you have any report or not – automated check hence they reveal the report and screwed my other quotation Why not it was revealed to me Why it was revealed so later Come on Do business with ethics When I ask give me the report which when they did not disclose me I think I do have rights to know But above all I was fully satisfied with customer service even if I am no more with only because of the above incident – information rights to know why they kept it hidden and not disclose the report earlier  
 I've been with for a few years and submitted claims for minor accidents but that was about six years ago Unfortunately I ran over a cat with my Mini Cooper two days ago and the serpentine belt was knocked off the sprocket when the poor cat was lodged between the alternator pulley and belt This is not an easy fix the Mini Turbo alternator is below the engine and requires extensive work to access the same I called claims the next morning and the receptionist was cordial I explained the situation and that the was not drivable He stated my claim would be evaluated within a few hours Later that day I received an e mail from stating my claim was on record and I could review the same on the internet Much to my chagrin the claim was considered closed Reason No in the area reported a missing animal WHAT So I sent an e mail to the claims office restating the problem and my dissatisfaction with their process Waited a few hours… no response I sent e mail with a simple question   I hit an animal with my Mini and the Alternator light came on… does my cover this damage    Shortly thereafter they replied   Yes your covers this damage minus your deductible… you receive an update to your claim shortly    That same day I received an e mail stating I had an appointment with a service department… no date time I logged on to their site found my claim and the appointment date time May AM AM e mail to their claim adjuster confirming the midnight appointment… hrs later no reply I eventually cancelled the appointment and check local shops for repair estimates The reason for this review questioning claim process lack of quality control and care for their customers always been satisfied with their service but then for the past years never required their help with a claim Now that I need them I have to keep banging on their door for help  
 I called to a quote on my new today The salesperson was sort of helpful until I him that I was shopping for quotes and that I plan on buying it right now He me that the quote rates may change when starting off and refused to change information on my quote because he   couldn't   I was genuinely considering buying a quote until he became rude to me  
 I feel that does not care about the people that are in an accident that that was not at fault cares about their own clients and not anyone else that was involved in the accident is cheap and does not want to pay what is fair or pay the other peoples medical bills is an insulting company that does not take all the other peoples medical bills inconsideration needs to look at everything that the other driver has to go through for the rest of their lives  
  WEDNESDAY April My was hit by a insured driver who ran a red light and hit me my Honda Civic in the right rear as I was turning left onto Watson Blvd she was on crutches as she out of her The witness statements from drivers behind me and drivers behind the insured woman stated that my traffic light was green and the insured woman's traffic light was red THURSDAY April I filed the police report and photographs of my damage and the driver's that hit me on the following day on website Friday April I began calling my assigned agent Ashley ** at a m the next day as the agent I spoke with on the previous night suggested and she took statements over the telephone I asked Mrs ** when the would be repaired She replied a m   Well I have to call the witnesses and you know they probably answer their phones since they know the number calling so it probably be Monday    I wondered if SHE COULD LEAVE A VOICE MAIL MESSAGE WITH THE WITNESSES TO CALL HER IF THEY WOULD NOT ANSWER THEIR PHONES I obviously would like my repaired quickly as per stated Auto Repair Xpress https www com claims autorepair I then asked when I could expect my to be repaired She did not know I reminded her of the Auto Repair Xpress promise She would not answer I asked for an estimate and after a few minutes she   Two weeks   I asked about a rental After ten minutes I understood that would pay a day for a rental from Enterprise Rent A since   They had a direct billing with them   She mentioned that if I rented a before authorized the rental that the before authorization rental would be merged I do not have full coverage so therefore I would have to pay the full coverage on the rental that would pay a day to provide me in the interim while my is repaired I thought about this and called back and talked to agent who answered at the same number I then asked if I could submit a day for a loaned from a friend during this time She answered with or rapid fire questions in answer to my question   Whose would I be using    I asked back   What difference whose I used until my was repaired    I am posting this because I would like my repaired as quickly as possible and Mrs Ashley and the other lady who answered my second call did not provide any forthright and clear answers to my queries of my repair and return to me or of my using and submitting a claim of per day use of an besides a rental because a rental would require me to pay a non reimbursable full coverage payment on the rental until my is repaired  
 I recently moved to AZ and switched my over while still maintaining my NY license failed to inform me that they stopped transmitting my coverage information to NY DMV after month NY therefore thought I was driving uninsured and suspended my license I was not aware of this I live in a Phoenix suburb with no means of transportation I may owe NY over in penalty I have been unable to anywhere including work or the Dr It has been a nightmare Although promised a supervisor would call me back to date they have not returned either of my two requests for a callback  
 Today I assigned myself the task of notifying all the companies with whom I have automatically debited payments of my new credit card expiry date been a customer for a LOT of years My call was answered by the anticipated computer I listened to the options There was no option for reaching a customer service representative Usually hitting       or       or remaining silent when the computer is trying to force more interactions do the trick This computer program was created by a sadist The computer demanded I   tell it   my issue I tried It it understand and began to recite its menu from the beginning I tried once more to no avail Then I began to recite   Customer service representative   over and over which ordinarily produces a human No luck the mindless repetitive demand that I tell it my issue I am a native English speaker with a mid western accent and a graduate degree and after being held captive by this damned computer I completely lost it and began screaming   No    every time it demanded I keep trying to talk to it   I know you want to talk to an agent but before I transfer you you must answer a few questions    Finally after several minutes of this with my screams rising in pitch and fury the computer surrendered and transferred me to computer that blared advertisements at me for minutes before a lovely young lady tried her best to put in the best possible light and adjusted my payment information People need jobs in this country and I find it frustrating that customer service is disappearing and businesses rely more and more on webpages and computers for customer interface If they are to force us to deal with computers on the telephone they NEED to provide an opt out choice that eventually allows you to reach a human being Of the businesses I called today was by far the worst  
 I have been an on time paying customer since The last couple of months had to make sacrifices to pay my bills pay for my medical expenses and buy grocery I thought things were fine after I made my last payment on for but when I log into my account & some change was scheduled to be withdrawn automatically on I called on Saturday to find out what was on The rep controlled the entire conversation She stated that because I removed auto pay on my account that increased my premium It sound like is trying to hold me hostage as a customer with these too frequent increases I noticed a silence on the other end did she hang up Not sure Well after her confusing explanation I logged back into my account The premium decreases to due on She explained this before disconnecting I asked   Why is the premium still high I afford this    She stated I would have to pay through June A month ahead I have never in my life heard of this one A customer being forced to pay months bills in advance This throw their payment plan out the window As far as the being due for April through June why are these exact payments showing different amounts due AGAIN For April through June This sound like a scam in operation and I want justice because knows that disabled and I have a budget I think a discrimination scam is brewing on this lizard  
 Although I may go with it be after more research But as for the experience of a quote I was very disappointed It seems they work on the hard sell practice I was having difficulty with the online quote so I called The agent was pleasant through the process and did save me considerable money Till I him I had to talk to my wife before changing companies I guess they want you to buy right away As he kept pushing and would not take later for an answer his tone changed slightly each time I resisted As a result I was forced to hang up I do plan on talking to my wife Then my sister in law who has them before calling back I hope not blackballed for this review  
 Many issues with I slid on black ice and totaled the Single accident No damage to anything else was very quick at sending an assessor out to look at the The assessor was very young and claimed that the is totaled Fine I dispute it However the assessor offered NADA value but the on the market costs a lot more than that I not be able to buy the same with that price working with the supervisor on this and gotten a response The accident occurred a month ago and still at a limbo nd problem is that I have both collision and comprehensive coverage claims insisted that processes black ice accidents as my fault and covered under collision rather than comprehensive However read online that this kind of accident is usually covered under comprehensive in which case I have to pay a deductible This issue is also unaddressed been with them for many years and I feel they've treated me poorly this time I dropped them in favor of USAA which reduced my premiums by several hundred dollars huge  
 Our was hit while parked at the hospital The person left a note What a blessing We reported the claim immediately our file was flagged because we had added the This policy is years old and it started on this Both my wife and I work for The first claims agent look to see we had updated our address Probably a new hire mistake Then we were assigned a seasoned claims agent all employees are auto directed to a special department for claims agents The agent we us we could certainly have a rental if we were willing to file the claim through our own because could not verify the responsible party I logged into the claims process online and found all the information the claims agent was unavailable So I called American Family with their claim number from the site and processed the rental and all of the features agent was not available unless I filed the claim through paying a deductible I am sure the information would have been processed in to days had I not taken the lead but that acceptable It also what the company promises Had I not been employed by I would have had to blindly wait and possibly pay out the deductible waiting for reimbursement Not acceptable I expect my clients to tolerate that service and frankly I am disappointed  
 I live in NY and signed my over to my sister in California a month before She would insure it I call to cancel my and they say I have to wait until I return the plates to the DMV Otherwise DMV charge me day No problem I understand the need to not allow plates to be reused improperly but make the refund retroactive to the date they no longer have to be responsible for the Nice for them they to collect extra days of without any obligation to cover a and I was first I was only insuring the license plates as if I was not insuring the  
I guess they gave me a good policy because my credit was good but they were not helpful when I was in an accident and then forced me to add a roommate to my auto policy if though he never drove my That made my rate triple 
 They charged me extra money and charged me with an accident that was not my fault Is it allowed for to charge for an accident even though you are not at fault This is totally wrong I hope something be done about that My premium went up approximately per six months I called and complain they lowered it to every six months deal with more than what I was paying every months  
 I had moved and a survey was sent to my address and which I never seen but disturb me as to our conversation over a price change The agent called out this to my attention and stated they received this invoice back and was notified that I moved of course I placed a forwarding address for my mail so how could I missed that hocus pocus How come it never forward to me instead of return to my Auto Insurer  
They always try to sell extra features that I cannot afford and try to sneak them into renewals They were originally cheaper than all the competitors but the price keeps dramatically increasing each renewal 
 My premium has increased by over dollars in the past year and I have not filed any claims with Across the board increases infuriates me If someone files claims then increase their premiums and leave others alone  
 I had sold my old in Florida and flew back to my home state of Pennsylvania Because I have even though I had sold the and cancelled the on that I had to pay the highest premium because I was uninsured The next year when I should have received a better rate there was a new reason why I was still paying the highest rate I even remember what the reason was Finally I went to a different company and a decent rate  
Never had a claim or traffic violation in years yet my rate goes up every year ridiculous My rates should be down or staying the same as a reward for being a good safe driver 
It took long time to process claims 
The claims agents were very helpful and professional and the claims process was fine Then they raise my rates What is for 
 My bi annual premium has gone up or times between Oct and Oct I switched to for lower premium but my savings from NJMIC are about eaten up with the increases I was that the increases were a result of higher repair costs in my area offered me a low rate initially but then their money back by increasing premiums little by little Before I know it be paying what I paid my old company When I asked why so many increases It was that repair costs had gone up in my area a new company is on my to do list although I suspect the same happen again with the new one They you coming and going  
 Took three different representatives to actually be helpful and do their job First woman complained about Christmas shopping which I never asked about was trying to make a claim Second woman refused to help or answer any questions and basically me to do everything with dealing with other companies What's the point of having customer service if you help them They never contacted me for other information and then blamed me later These people ** care  
   communicate well with me and had hidden fees they would not explain I felt like a number not a person They also only have office in my city that was hard to to every month and would charge me extra if I chose to pay with my card by phone  
 I have insured multiple with over a +yr span Been a excellent customer for them Pay on time filed many claims In fact my husband and I's record is currently clean So would assume would give us competitive rates for homeowners ins Not so tried to charge me what it should have cost and tried to pressure me to accept it I found a reasonable rate and notified them be taking ALL my business to the other company and they care Sometimes being loyal   pay    
I've been with for years now and rates go higher instead of any discounts no good behavior or good driving skills discounts Plus now that my is older the cost to insure it should be down 
 I had bad customer service our agent was never in the office or called us back when we needed to talk to them So we cancelled our and went to another The coverage was great the price was good too Make sure to go through everything with your agent and see everything you are covered and NOT covered because the rental coverage for a bit extra save you in the long run You a good value for what you pay for with the and everyone decides what they need and need so prices do vary But overall a good deal I was happy Our agent was never around we would call and we phone calls in return We would stop by the office and it would be closed in the middle of the day They were never there We would have to hunt them down We finally gave up and cancelled  
 Their   insurance agents   seem to be girls in their s with little experience of any type let alone in auto The company is cheap but screws up every time I deal with them including incorrectly reporting I had made a claim when I actually had not and not bothering to call me at a crucial time but instead sending an email which I never saw After years with them they have screwed up this much without my ever having made a claim  
 Good service until I into my first fender bender In the beginning my main representative was always helpful and thorough in giving me the details of my prices I was satisfied with the amount I had to pay After the accident my yearly prices were hiked up drastically My representative would give me the run around when it came to my bills I would be it would be set price which I would pay promptly I would then receive bill later claiming I had not paid the full amount I called up representatives and would be conflicting information each time I have not changed my but I plan to quit soon  
I think it is an ok auto company I have had them for about years and they did raise my premium once without an accident so that is why I checked star ratings only 
 Overall I have not had any issues with but the cost of our auto is outrageous I also had issues with linking my homeowners with them I found it to be ridiculous My grandparents were with for + years and recently switched to company because of the extremely high cost Overall I am happy with the service The cost is a little hard to swallow at times  
Because I have bad credit I am charged a higher rate I have no tickets or accidents I am a good risk with bad credit I am not happy with this practice How many other are like me And the company makes more off of me 
I think that they have enough coverage for the amount you have to pay And why is it that they say Michigan has the highest rates What's so different here from other states Ask that question and see if you a real response 
 I have been a customer with company for more than years when I heard about minutes I tried I was initially given a better quote than my old so I switch to Recently I received a cancellation letter from for nonpayment I called agent informing them that I never received any bill from them and that I am ready to pay the bill immediately I was that I have to start a new quote The new quote given to me is now much higher than that of my old left because of fifteen minutes I believe is using the minutes as quote initially and later find a way jacking up your fees this is dubious How could I receive cancellation letter but not received bills is not telling the truth so beware of what you wish for in fifteen minutes  
 The representatives I dealt with were professional and friendly However after being a victim of an auto accident that % was not my fault and being the best customer could hope for not having any traffic violations in my entire driving history the last accident I was in was over years ago and I was the passenger I pay on time etc and paying for the best they offer they refused to give me enough money to buy the same old truck as I had before the accident I looking for fancy and I looking for better the same old truck They tried to say that I should look at autos at plus miles away seriously I asked them to fix my but they refused that also since it would cost more than what they wanted to pay me So even if I more expensive rates I wait to move to a company that actually pay to replace your auto I be sure to make it my mission to share my story I do sincerely hope you go out of business not a tear be shed  
 I have been with for over five years No accidents in that time As a good driver I expect to see rates go down as I am not a big risk not up In the past three times or so in a row my six month policy has gone up When I asked them about it they give the excuse rates are up in the area I buy that bull because even if true why are good drivers being penalized for bad drivers I have to pay for the faults of others Why do I want to stay with a company who treats me like that My rates should go DOWN for being a good driver Or even stay the same Something is certainly wrong when I switch to Progressive and quoted about less with the exact same coverage I know all the games companies play but I shop around I have to take this crap anymore  
 I had from you guys yet it seem every time we talk to customer service is   Bad   to things done in this company I kindly ask to have my daughter's removed and it took me several more than calls to answers 'Till finally they me I needed to have a proof that she no longer drive the because she was away from school Then they would not remove her because they supposedly could not read the email Send many more still having issues then I forgot to pay my on time I call to reinstate it and they wanted to give a new quote and pay balances from cancellation I am very disappointed in your customer service The day I call to reinstate my I was my daughter still in my and she is listed as being away from school when I clearly asked to have her removed I really know what you guys are thinking but your customer service sucks I hope you guys work more ethically and not trying to people's money  
 I have a Honda Civic and in I struck a large raccoon on the highway which caused damage to the radiator and caused the engine to overheat replaced my engine with a salvaged engine This past week my began to overheat and I took it to my mechanic He looked at the and directed to a Honda service bulletin pertaining to cracked engine blocks The engine used in my was of the affected engines however because it was a salvage engine Honda would not service it This left me with the only option being to go back to because they guaranteed the work and parts for the life of the I was advised today that because it was a manufacturer defect that would not repair the engine As a result I am left in the position where the manufacturer not touch the problem because the engine is salvaged and who placed the salvage engine in my not fix it because they think it is a manufacturer problem Any suggestions besides confining to press to fix the problem  
 They handled the claim well overall but took a very long time to do so and the whole entire process was very long and tedious Overall this became very frustrating Their coverage options are very extensive and they offer lots of different options based on whatever you are looking for for yourself They have coverage options personalized to fit your needs The overall value of the coverage is very good to start with but in time the rates started to go up more and more increasingly and making the value not as great as it once was I have never really had any problems with the customer service people that I have encountered from there They have always been very helpful and have solved my problems as quickly as possible  
 I have a complaint I originally became a licensed driver in NY state in In or I drove my girlfriend's and was stopped Her card was not in the it was in her house which was in long Island NY Before I could rectify the incident we broke up Since I prove coverage my license was suspended I basically could not afford the fines at the time well over so I moved to NYC where I need a license Fast forward years I had to buy a because I could no longer my year old mother around on public transportation I was given a quote of between and per month at full coverage due to your policy of discounting driving experience prior to the last three calendar years at the time of application Notwithstanding the fact that I paid the fines due from and took and passed a written and road test and that prior to my suspension in I had a total of points in six years with no accidents The last points were from I feel that my prior driving experience should be counted so that I receive a quote at a lower rate I turn this month I went back to College as an older person last year and graduate in the Spring of but my is in a rented driveway wasting away because I afford the rates I went to and passed Driver Education in high school and have no recorded accidents on my record I have proof of everything I have claimed above i e my Drivers Record from DMV my college transcripts etc It would please me if someone from your company could contact me and rectify this apparent injustice with some type of waiver I could understand if I was some kid with a horrific driving record but I am middle aged bordering on being a senior citizen who has driven for years with no accidents Thank you for your time  
 Got an emergency roadside assistance in my policy Ran out of gas in Indiana near South Bend on I Called advised the rep from the very beginning that there are kids in the and we are on a major highway and are scared that big trucks might hit us middle of the night We spent min on the phone with the rep verifying our information only to find out that IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO ASSIST US ON THAT ROAD What Where is the list of which roads they are authorized to service customers and where not I was never given a disclaimer about these limitations when I was signing up Ended up calling police and a local service which cost us  
 As I was turning off highway Havelock NC onto Ketner blvd I was struck by who ran the stop sign I was that even though I had the right way and   I   had to slow down almost to a complete stop to make the turn and I saw the approaching the intersection where she was required to come to a complete stop and look both ways which she did not do or she would have seen me has me I should have stopped The young lady ask if we could exchange information which I was hesitant to do so but after talking to the police and my co who it was ok I did so report every accident to the police no matter how small Needless to say I have been screwed by my and hers co  
 My windshield was damaged on the Freeway by a large brick boulder on the Interstate I was unable to catch the truck to the necessary information I called to file a claim and was that it would have to be at my expense because my deductible is They definitely take your money every month but paying a claim to the customer without the customer being inconvenienced is beginning to be a rarity  
 I have been insured with auto for years now I switched because at the time the rates were lower than my previous company My rates with have gone up a bit over the years but really not badly considering been years I did want to shop around however now that my daughter is nearing driving age Insuring a teen is pricey and as a single mom on a budget I needed to make sure I was the best available rates An agent acquainted with from company talked to me in great detail about several discounts I and options I have discounts that hold for the next to years The upshot was that I could either reduce my payment or better coverage for what I am now paying I chose the latter and when my daughter starts to drive the payments of course increase but not by nearly as much as I feared or that heard they would increase from other friends Other companies must have been triggered about my search on the internet because almost immediately I heard from other actual human beings from about a half dozen other companies a couple of which I contacted to make sure I was the best deal I could Unfortunately I never spoke with I tried their website led me to contact information for an agent in my area but an email and a phone call netted no response I realize you change your coverage online but my price would increase a great deal Apparently no wanted to hear   But gosh other companies insure me for a lot less we talk about some discounts I might be able to as a loyal year customer    The upshot is that I have now very happily switched to Liberty Mutual My policy with be cancelled in couple of weeks and they know that Not   We're sorry to see you go what could we have done better   email call etc I leave with the opinion that they are not a bad company thought I only had to use them once for a claim they were very good about it but very impersonal compared to other companies and that is why I am leaving Maybe they feel not cost effective to take the time to personally reach out but they lost a customer by not reaching out to me so I would suggest they re think that  
 I had an   at fault   accident years ago in August Afterwards increased my from per month to per month Yesterday I received a letter from stating that as of July it is to increase to per month due to the accident I asked for a copy of the edict from the state of Calif as they blamed the increase on the state's new   safe driver   qualifications and they refused to send it They that their letter to me was proof enough two years after my accident a little late to raise my rate They have already increased it once due to the accident I cannot pay per month for My Honda lease is only  
 I have been an auto policy holder for only six months Within this period quite satisfied with the premium they charged me But unfortunately this renewal period I accidentally look at my email and found out that after this six month period they already raised up my premium from to To my surprise after six months of coverage a rate increased at once even wait for a year to do it So I called up their billing number and ask about it and I was about the   rising cost of    What did I do I her my son is currently insured with them too and his renewal did not change She he's due for an increase too What a BS If the case in my mind you lose me & my son as your client I believe this company is in the business of deceiving luring people to their business I not recommend this company to friends & family  
 A insured rolled on highway between Del Rio and Sonora TX and did damage to my property It damaged approximately ft of ranch fence mature hardwood trees left a lot of trash and allowed the escape and death of exotic animals that we depend onto make a living No from the law enforcement the driver or owner ever tried to contact us about the property damages It took us a month to a police report to find out who had the and the accident At first was very helpful and wanted quotes or estimates for damages We jumped through hoops and that information to them Now it seems as if has gone out of business We cannot any info from them or them to talk to us to let us know the claim status If we look online at the claim there is nothing there I am wondering if anyone else has this problem and if I am wasting my time trying to handle this myself I am losing money every day that I cannot replace my animals or repair my fence Should I let an attorney handle this and see how much he make us  
 My children and I were leaving from the gas station and there was a in front of us All of a sudden the put the reverse lights on and I beep my horn numerous times to try and stop the wreck but the in front of us continued to reverse and bang I called the police and no police report because he that it was not a lot of damage and it was night so you see all of the damage only a exchange form Also we went to examined at the hospital the same day and there was minor injuries but also emotional distress I called and filed a claim the following day on the at fault I had to call the adjuster and she recorded my statement of what happened She went from being cordial to being offensive insinuating things and misjudging me Bringing up things that had nothing to do with the accident a good mom and a good person and it was wrong for a stranger to misjudge me that way The accident is under investigation right now because the driver was an inexperienced driver and the is in her mom name so waiting on the adjuster to retrieve a police report and talk to the owner of the at fault I believe everyone deserves to be treated fairly especially if that person is being nice I thank God was with me and my kids that night because they are my pride and joy And not our fault that the driver at fault did not look back before reversing  
 For claim they increase my premium When submit my claim they comprehensive then they changed to collision Again I called to cancel my claim They   We do any changes in premium   but they did I hate policy in this country Worst less Stealing  
Case # ** happen November of Parked in a lot at a restaurant my was rubbed by insured person I lost a sale to my due to wrong posting to CARFAX that was in a wreck by company Need help 
I have been driving for years and have had no accidents and no tickets I recently in my first accident and had a claim totaling it You would think it affect my much right WRONG I my fixed and sold it I went to a new and my went from to all because of the fender bender We tried a quote without an accident and it was a big difference from SMALL ACCIDENT Very disappointed 
 I was with for over years and had fairly good service from them even when dealing with claims Recently though my was cancelled because my payment go through with my bank Since it was past my cancellation date when the payment was returned cancelled my with no notice to me As a matter of fact I received notification of when my next payment was due like usual When I contacted to make my regular payment they informed me that my policy had actually been cancelled and that there was nothing they could do to prevent it since the payment was returned after my cancellation date I asked why I receive notification of the cancellation and they they were sending a letter but it was not in their policies to give a courtesy call when the policy cancelled and that the normal notifications I was receiving although misleading were a quirk in their system They would not even give me a quote for a new policy until I paid the balance due The lapse in cost me fine from my state I am now with Progressive They assured me that even if a payment was returned to them after my cancellation date they would contact me first before cancelling my policy I pay more with Progressive but I think the peace of mind and customer service are well worth it  
Everyone that is trying to deal with should know that the company digs in your credit report without your knowledge or permission This is what happened to me and I protested it I am yet to an explanation from the company 
 For some reason I have to call for my card I have insured with your company my payments are automatically taken out from my account every month always on time But why my cards sent to me And my registration and safety check is due I feel not doing their job and I be looking for company This is like the rd time within months  
 I called claims to see if my premium or account be affected in any way if I made a claim about some minor damage that had occurred to my passenger's side door The representative ran their Accident Evaluation Tool and deduced that my premium would not change and that no accident would be placed on my record I went ahead and filed a claim and took the to the collision center The claims adjuster me that a sealant would fix the issue but he decided to replace the door and the side mirror as well I honestly do not understand why he replaced the side mirror as there was absolutely no damaged to the mirror He failed to tell me that by doing all this work the cost to repair door would become over resulting in placing an   at fault accident   on my record and charging me roughly more to my premium The claims adjuster made unnecessary repairs to my chose a more expensive option when there was a cheaper alternative available without an explanation as to how it would affect me and as a result I have been unfairly charged for the past year and an at fault accident has been placed on my record preventing me from a better deal at agency My family and I have been auto and home policy holders for over a decade This treatment and inability to resolve the situation is unacceptable  
Buyer beware has very over aggressive sale agents They say anything to you to agree to buy a policy My experience was bait and switch I was given a price for the policy with a reference number but when I went to purchase it changed It did so at the last moment after listening to the legal recording that I was to agree to When I complained I was sent a email documenting how it is with in the law It is true they are not doing anything illegal but clearly they are missing some ethical values The whole experience was as slimy as the little Lizard 
 First and foremost I have had since s when I joined the army Throughout my career I had them even when I was overseas They are a great company for the most part My recent experience has been frustrating and dehumanizing I am a disabled army veteran Proudly served my country from until I am a below the knee amputee In October I had a blowout on i I called and they sent a tow truck out to change my tire I went to new tires and was the wheel was damaged I called Margaret ** my local adjuster She called me in she accessed the damage and gave me the forms to go repair my I went to route gmc They ordered the parts and called me in I waited hours and the dealer tells me Margaret Meg advised they had to a supplemental because they wanted to charge an additional This is when the adventure in poor customer service and incompetence began I go see Meg again I am my Meg someone named Jennifer would be in touch never happened I call Meg who goes from being the nicest woman in the world to it is not my job Jennifer is supposed to contact me I called her supervisor and after several calls he Jeff has taken call of the problem and tell me to go to the dealer on Thursday at I call frank at the route gmc Buick he has not heard from I called Jeff again and he finally calls the dealer I was a member of the biggest customer service organization in the world the US Army If we dont take care of people and shirk responsibility someone dies How a company as big as have so many incompetent people that lack empathy and compassion for an amputee and a disabled veteran Go figure maybe I should look at USAA  
 After shopping around for a better deal on I discovered that who was my carrier was reporting an accident against me that was clearly not my fault I was rear ended by an uninsured motorist who had their driver's license suspended paid my claim minus a deductible and I was the accident would not count against me In addition my son backed into which resulted in very minor damage to the other in which I paid out of pocket to remedy the situation insisted that I give them all the facts about the incident When I refused generated a claim to force me to give them the information This led me to promptly cancel the policy and end a year business relation with  
 I had to switch companies because is a trip First of all the representatives on the phone quoted me a few different quotes and none of them were accurate Also their policy of college drivers is not beneficial at all to me The rep was talking in circles and my bill reflected that After eight years had enough Saving % in minutes worth the hassle  
 When I first insured my with the price was fine Then when it was time to renew this is every months they kept increasing my premium even though I never filed any claims I questioned them and received the reply that it was due to an increase in claims related costs Fine Why am I paying for that it be your rate goes down when you file a claim Instead charges everyone more even the good drivers because of the bad drivers they insure This company what it claims to be I am now insured through Allstate and the premium for months is less than the last premium gave me for months  
  is terrible and look out for the interest of their clients their pockets They terminated my policy due to an accident I was involved in Despite it my fault and the other claimed full responsibility now I am stuck since other carriers are very expensive  
  a horrible company although I have yet to test their mettle with an accident but found very tight with their discounts fall for the   take our defensive driving course   NSC and pay off the fee with discounts including all the other drivers in your household fall for it they'll give you discount for every months no matter how many drivers take the course and pass simply not worth it  
 They are not advising people that in California if you sign up for automatic payment using a checking account that you save I was by customer service that listed in the packet that has lots of fine print showing this discount On the web site it lists it only in part of the automatic payments sign up at the bottom in fine print of this discount So if you sign up at through a rep they might not mention this or advise you to only sign up for automatic payments using a credit card It seems they are trying not to make it too clear of this discount in order to make some extra cash company trying to pull over the little guy  
 In March of I pulled over for driving without I was paying my every month In the state of CT you cannot drive without it so obviously my towed luckily to my house The next day I went down to the company and them what was on They assured everything was back to normal and I had again A week or two later I pulled over for the same thing At this point I was very upset but they let me go with a ticket or warning I remember Anyway I went down there again and they printed out a letter stating that I was paying my and everything was fine The letter was basically my card Sometime in April I pulled over AGAIN This cop decided to ask me and my little cousin to step out of the and before I knew I was handcuffed and in the back of the cop years old never been in trouble with the law scared out of my mind Luckily they let me go once my Aunt came and once again my was towed to my house THANK GOD Anyway everything with the was fine from that point on I bought a   new   this past March Last night I pulled over for a taillight being out The cop once again me that my was suspended I PAY EVERY MONTH WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING time let it go times fine but four times And a year and a half later No done with them This only happen to me either My friend was in the same situation with them before DONE WITH  
  client ran into my causing damage to my client out her came to my ask me was I ok and ask me to move my from the street I refused to move my and call and explained to the dispatcher what happen client upset with me because I refused to move my at her request When the officer arrived he came to my and asked what happen which is on camera I explain to the officer the officer ask for both license and I gave him my information client had to wait for her daughter to bring her auto information The officer gave me my information back and me to have a nice day and I left The next day I call to file the claim but client had call and that she run into my I turned it over to the law they had pay me for pain and suffering but pay to have my repaired So now I have to attorney to make repair my because not right for someone to run into a person and think okay and is holding their client in the wrong that they do The judge client that no court in the state of Georgia is to back her on this because she was wrong I never ever referral or mention to none of my family members or friends of anybody that I even think I know They are wrong and when you do people wrong nothing good happen For that client of everything that client and touch fail even the adjusters holding the client in their wrongdoings I could never do that to anyone no matter what color they are because how seen me a black person  
 Well kinda new to this still young and not sure how the whole thing works But I was shopping around for quotes came across as being the cheapest for what it had to offer for me expect that So I go through the quote call them as I sure if the price offered was for real So after I all set up they tell me how I have to go have photos taken of my and I say to them   Will it affect anything if I have a little tiny chip in my front fender as I hit a water covered pothole in a parking lot last year that cause it to chip a little    I NEVER turned this damage in as a claim in my previous holder because it was so little amount of damage worth it and my dad could fix it Well because I that to the sales representative turns out they use that information against you and raise your   risk level   and charge you more even if you file it as a claim it still counts against you So though telling the truth is good a heads up admit and tell them nothing otherwise you pay for it like me Not only did this cost me more apparently even though it a claim on my previous company is now to hold this against my   risk factor   for the next years Given I stay with them that long doubt it  
I do my best to let everyone I know or meet that they should not insure with this company They are famous for giving you the runaround and then not paying claims that their insured has caused 
The people you speak with on the phone are NOT licensed agents Their supervisor is They are famous for selling lower limits which could put you in a pickle if you into a serious accident Know before you buy Protect yourself 
My son had the the right of way Starting out from standing at light as soon as it turned green Hit a that did not have the right of way Other driver turning left after green arrow had changed to green light did not yield to oncoming traffic found my son their customer at fault due to lack of evidence and because in lane next to him did not hit the who failed to yield paid to have the other fixed My son's old no collision coverage remains unrepaired His liability coverage has been increased for the next months 
 I it Okay was the lowest priced when I was shopping around but since then every months my rates keep up Knock on wood I received any traffic ticket of any kind and been in an accident I called every time I the bill and ask and they say because I am in a high risk area and that due to cost But why me Why not raise the people that have accidents I guess I am subsidizing them with my money not fair  
 Car was towed here after an accident which I was at no fault and was everything would be taken care of by my company and I would not have to pay anything out of pocket When I went to go pick up my plates they me my soon to be canceled company has not even paid the days that they were to cover gave me about a day's notice to my towed out of there because they it was to be my responsibility to rid of the The shop would not release the until the bill was settled or weeks later finally sends a check for only half of the bill about of around for storage for less than a month sent the check about a week and a half later after the date they they were to cover so my has been incurring storage fees while they took their time sending that check Now the shop wants me to pay the difference and says its my problem and I have to work it out with them The money I for the value of my I now have to use to pay for the ridiculous storage fees that BM Auto Collision is charging after they specifically me from day I would not have to pay I asked several times throughout the month to pull my out of there but they insisted on leaving it there that would take care of the bill My has been sitting there since Feb st and is still there today I have been trying to in contact with the owner but has not responded to my phone calls I am now having to consult with attorneys for possible solutions I am also now incurring rental charges out of pocket since yesterday because I now have money to even pay for I feel like I am being hustled by my company and the auto shop  
 All CGI & little heart According to # when someone crashes their junky ' sedan into your brand new parallel parked sports because they are recklessly speeding down a busy residential street it is your fault and you assume all liability for the accident I fathom what their logic is The street I was parked snugly to the curb on is right next to a kids park My door was cracked open a couple of inches and I was total deer in the headlights because I thought they were gonna possibly end my life and I was bracing for it And the person who hit me immediately after that they were in a big hurry to to the other side of town They were likely looking at Maps on their phone as they nearly in a head on with an oncoming causing them to swerve to avoid it and they have enough time to correct their course before hitting me I think interesting the cost of replacing a brand new sports door probably a couple grand at least is far less than the scratch on someone's old bumper already loaded with scratches anyways If I want to use my comprehensive I still pay a deductible and my rates go up Guess chalk this up to sometimes when you save money you honestly what you pay for I not be renewing or recommending to anyone Oh and so you know not okay to have your door open even a couple of inches when parallel parked you be held liable for any random that crashes into you Thanks for letting me vent And I let it go  
  policy holder merged into my lane and forced me to the curb The claims investigator called me at PM and insisted that I had to participate in a recorded question and answer session The investigator was adversarial Would not let me read my prepared written statement rather he asked questions Used a needling technique by interrupting me several times and saying   I have to make sure the recorder is working properly    Used the investigating technique of asking the same question times Bottom line I was interrogated like a common criminal when in fact I had been driving home from church at PM and had tried to lessen the damage to both when the other driver forced me to the curb Luckily the insured was not damaged Maybe I should have let the driver sideswipe me  
 I live on Maui and heard that if you drive less than miles per day your company give you a much lower rate I called and spoke to   Timothy   who in addition to being arrogant was abrasive while trying to impress upon me that he was a   professional   When I him that I wanted a quote relating to me driving less than miles day he me that he give me a quote and that I be calling to talk to him I went on to say that it would save me time if he could tell me if they have a program that saved money for those who drove less the miles day He became adamant to the point of being abrasive I him that I did not appreciate him interrupting me in mid statement and as a consequence of his demeanor I am seriously considering taking my business elsewhere I was fortunate in that because of Timothy's distasteful manner I was determined to look into other companies I found that Allstate had a program that provided low mileage drivers a policy and that policy covered both of my for a total of per year It is minimum coverage but in my circumstance all I need rate for the same coverage is per year I hope obvious to that because of Timothy with Allstate I justify paying extra for Timothy's arrogance In closing I need to say that in the process of all of this and after speaking with Timothy and quotes from a couple of other companies and even after my negative experience with Timothy I decided that I would see if had a better rate They I spoke to a young lady Rhoda from who lives in Hawaii and who graciously and courteously spent time to generate a quote subsequent to my conversation with Timothy of year My present policy ** was costing me year so a savings of year Not bad But once again mainly because of Timothy's attitude toward customers I am severing my relationship as a customer of his company Nor I recommend the company he works for to anyone I know  
 I opened a new policy with new back in I swapped out of my in May and was offered the MBI I the rep that I do not need or want it Why would I need MBI coverage for a brand new that is under manufacturer warranty So I my new policy and she put the coverage on there and charged me for it anyways That was the st incident Now Oct I swapped out on my policy for a new and was offered the same MBI and was I needed more coverage since it was a leased and was required by the lender I had my lease in hand and the representative clearly was using a sales tactic on me and I her the lease stated the coverage requirements and they were way lower than what she had quoted so she proceeded to insist on the MBI I specifically that I do not need or want it Again it is a new with bumper to bumper coverage and I had purchased additional coverage from the dealership on both my So I received my revised policy and I HAVE MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN on BOTH I am so irritated I called and spoke to a nice person who apologized over and over for the shady actions of her fellow co workers but I cancelled my policy because they would not refund all of my money for the MBI that I did not ask for this company knowingly sells product to people that they even need even after it has been declined in a very upfront way I would never do business with them again I would rather pay more to a reputable company than deal with shady people  
 On April th I bought a new home and called my current provider I wanted to see what homeowner's policy would be and if there were any discounts for having through them They me I would have discounts not only for my home but my auto as well They me my premium for my would drop from to every six months My homeowner's policy seemed reasonable at a year So before I decided to start the home I wanted to call around and see if there were any better deals out there I have been with for almost years and was curious if I was a good deal After calling around I found a reputable company that could offer me a year for my home which a huge deal but could offer me my for for the same coverage This sounded like a great deal so I decided to call and cancel Once I talked to an agent they me that they had to transfer me to the cancellation department I was put on hold briefly and a gentleman by the name of Michael I believe came on the phone He he was   sad to see me go   but it sounds like I a good deal elsewhere He did want to check a few things before he cancelled my policy I asked what exactly he meant by that He me that he thought that there were new discounts that started in Texas and he wanted to see if they would apply to me After being on hold for a few minutes he comes back on the line and tells me that I would qualify for these new discounts He tells me that my current policy would drop from to and my home would now be instead of This sounded great so I him I wanted to stay and I called my new provider and them to not start the policy I thought this was great and was glad I did not have to leave but I was sadly mistaken So last week I received my renewal sheet and my price went UP I was shocked due to the fact I had not into any accidents or had any tickets I had zero claims as well My went up higher than what I was originally paying I was paying which was reduced to last term but on this term they wanted me to pay So after reading this I decided to call and see what was on After talking to countless agents most of them could not tell me why my rates went up let alone why it was higher than I was originally paying person did tell me it was a statewide increase which I thought was total BS I ended up checking around AGAIN for other companies I ended up back to company that quoted me months prior and luckily similar prices to what they quoted me before I then called to finally cancel my policy and once again they transferred me to   cancellation specialist   He gave me the same pitch that they did months prior I them I was not interested in their   new statewide discounts   and made him cancel my policy I never felt that was a shady company till last week DO NOT be fooled by these alleged   newly found state discounts   or that you are rated different all of a sudden This is a ploy to have you stay with them to charge you more your next renewal If something sounds too good to be true or fishy then it is  
 I have been with off and on for years a great driver no tickets no nothing I have never had to file a claim since I was sixteen years old day when I out of the Walgreens parking lot I noticed that the passenger front side fender had a small dent No left a note and of course I was so upset Later that day I called to file a claim The process too bad they assigned me a claim representative and they me to go through of their facilities Service King and they even set up me up with a rental My was repaired in days They did a great job and was very pleased months later I had to renew my policy My premium rate was a month for full coverage with deductible each my coverages for NO good reason jumped to quoting me a month for the same coverages When I asked the representative she that everyone rates are up in my area I   Oh really    Then she   The rates might also be to that claim that you filed   I the claim that was a hit and run and not a claim that was my fault I was so upset After I hung up with and started looking for rates quotes Very pleased to hear from these companies like State Farm who me that your should have NOT gone up because of the hit and run Also spoke with Progressive and they asked me what paid out I they paid out for the claim I have the whole estimate from they that made your rate go up either unless they paid out a or more on a claim So I know is lying to me now trying to charge me all that money a month on something that my fault Anyway a great deal with State Farm a month for the same coverages I had with Beware if you have and have to file a claim that is NO fault of your own Even a small claim Your rates go through the roof Buyer beware  
 My was hit in Nov parked and been paying out of my pocket ever since I had my returned to the Auto shop of Sullivan on May due to the turn signals not working & my steering wheel locking up and I able to drive that & in addition the loud noise when driving over pothole street repairs I called the body shop to advise and was that they would tow the and to start the repairs The reason for the tow was the CLOCK SPRING & other things My was hit on the driver's side front and had to have several things fixed & replaced When I went to pick my up I was that I owed for the tow I was upset I was to contact Emergency Roadside Assistance I called and was that I would be reimbursed & to fax my copy of my invoice over That was done I received my refund back but it was If I have that coverage on my account why should I not receive the total amount of back in return This whole experience has been a nightmare especially with the Auto body shop that was referred by giving them a star I beg to differ on that one I have been with for years and to be treated like this Tonight I be looking for new Co thanks to this experience WORD OF THE DAY DOES ANYONE CARE  
Everything took a long time to process Was not very friendly service and very hard to contact the right person without being transferred ten times I would not recommend Very expensive for not very good service There are a few options but again they gave me of the highest rates and I have a great driver’s record There is no value in Terrible customer service and they are not helpful for anything that I tried to do with them Most of the agent workers were very rude and did nothing to help solve any problems I had an accident that was not my fault and I was treated as the person who was at fault 
 I signed with as a new customer at the end of February A month later my was parked and hit I called with the information and called the police as they requested I took the in for estimated damages as requested Then the   hell   began Once the claim was in I started the runaround about the process needing approvals by managers supervisors etc Then I received a call days later from some guy stating he's with and wanted to ask more questions about the accident and would call me a few days later to ask the questions When he called he he needed to record the statements and then he started acting like he was with the FBI with his questions Bottom line main goal is to not pay the claim and use any means and tactic necessary to not pay Go with agency I'm warning you  
 Oscar is by far the worst manager at I have been a model customer for years but when I called to inquire about separating the policy I shared with my soon to be ex husband the representative immediately canceled me out of our policy and created a new policy for me I tried explaining that I wanted to wait until our joint policy expired before separating anything since the policy was already paid for The representative refused to listen to what I had to say and days later I received a bill from with a new policy under my name only starting on the day I had called I called again and talked with Oscar the manager He was rude and condescending and even had the nerve to tell me that I was overly sensitive because I was through a divorce I him that if they decided to cancel my portion of the joint policy before its expiration day they should refund me the difference and he flat out no These people are dirty thieves so I have reported them to the commissioner of California I have a credit score of and never have had an issue with any company before but I fight tooth and nail to prevent from taking advantage of their loyal customers Shame on you  
 My husband's last wish is that I post his recent experiences with significant others and after of their drivers ran a stop sign hitting us while we rode our bicycles We were celebrating the bike ride for our th wedding anniversary My husband risked his life to save mine and in the process he was further injured because the driver never stopped The officer never interviewed us and the driver initially had never reported the accident were deaf ear denying the responsibility to pay the claim for my husband With unnecessary delays Mr ** eventually ended up in intensive care with internal injuries for several days After being released from the hospital he was ready again for life and would begin his road to recovery for the next few months Then the unthinkable informed medical provider derogatory information regarding the claim as they could not see a person risking their life to save another which happened in this instant Shortly thereafter we contacted the State of Florida Dept of Finance who that they received information that we had already settled the claim This was never true His benefits were held up and or set aside which created a spiral of events out of pocket expenses and other bizarre incidents with medical provider services etc which is too sensitive to post However he continued his quest to justice and continued his efforts to well He me that many people suffer through similar situations and they have no voice He was a courageous man He to me a few days prior   I am the people's voice    He believed it was his civil duty as a citizen of the United States to be that way and knew justice would prevail regardless of the cause He was also a naturalist and body builder and believed in good health His daily inspiration which he shared with many was to have a perfect balanced mind body and spirit soul It was his passion Although he is gone in the body and is in God's divine presence now I still feel his love and comfort In my husband's honor I post his last wish I know he be pleased  
 My was a total loss undervalued my claim according to my ex husband that works for a major company by I the runaround and no would explain the reimbursement methodology according to industry standards He has been an adjuster for plus years and gave me information to prove them wrong to no avail This experience has taken years off my life and hope this helps the next person searching for a respectable company  
 I have never experienced such a problem making a payment as I have with in the past two weeks A payment was made to my account by an associate of mine I come to find out a week later that the policy was not paid and then cancelled because did not process the payment correctly because the person's name was not on my account They took the payment and transferred it to their claims department saying they did not know for whom it was After several emails and phone calls made by myself the cardholder and the cardholder’s bank they still have not rectified my account If they made an error it needs to be fixed They kept asking me for something I could not give being I am not the cardholder and would not give me the policyholder the same information they gave my associate and his bank I am completely disgusted at this point by how this is being   handled   and know what to do Almost two weeks later it is still not corrected and I have no And to top it off they know they made an error because they have not reported anything to the DMV If this was truly my fault my registration would be suspended by now Crazy changing companies as soon as I can This is the worst experience I have ever had and not even my own fault  
  seems to have an endless amount of really stupid commercials You know the caveman the pig all the dumb jokes and parodies and of course their main pun the talking gecko It must somehow work for them because they continue to spend billions of dollars for these ads and attract new suckers to their company My wife was recently hit by someone with There was no police report We decided to file a claim with his company I submitted clear diagrams to showing how it was his fault After five days they finally sent an adjuster He took the usual pictures and then went about to find parts online with his   machine    I was watching him and thought it very unethical that he was searching for used parts instead of new He finally came up with an estimate of about He since there was no police report we would have to split the fault Then he offered to write me a check for only and settle it I him I would wait and consider his offer further So I called my own company Allstate and filed a claim with them instead I sent them the same documentation I had sent to An adjuster arrived early the very next morning who took his pictures and searched for new parts His estimate came to and he made the check out to me for that entire amount on the spot We even half of our deductible back after they finished settling the claim with in court some months later That was worth I am so glad I dropped that claim with They were clearly trying to rip me off I received more from Allstate no dummy I fall for their not so cute little commercials and sucked in as of their customers But there are many who do For those people I only ask that they listen very closely to the last three words in their commercials subliminal yet true Listen for it It says   moron    They are offering for morons  
 I was involved in an accident on I waited to hear from and did not hear from anyone I went and an estimate on my own I faxed it over once your agent called me You requested pictures of the truck I also sent them I received call and asked for pictures of the VIN the odometer reading and the entire truck I have complied with each and every request It is now the th of the month and I am still waiting for the results I think that days from the time of the accident is quite some time to have to wait for your adjuster If you required more information or if I have done something wrong please inform me Otherwise I would appreciate you handling the problem  
  expect any support or money from I have an auto policy with Last month my was rear ended by motorist I was that I would have to file a claim with the other company and that I would only be reimbursed if the other company which was AAA decided to pay the claim I have never heard of such a thing 
 I called in to today to check and see if a previous quote given was still in the system I spoke to Dan ** who me what the quote was and he immediately wanted to write the policy I him I would not the policy until Oct and he suddenly blurted out that I would have to my license within days and I him I was informed by the first agent of that and he then demanded to know if I would have my license I him I planned on having it but the courts wanted me to have the SR first and then the judge would determine my fines I him I had to pay the fines and because I did not know what they were I could not speak in the affirmative because I needed to know what they were He became angry at this and he needed to speak to his manager I was still wondering how I was still on the phone when all I wanted to know was if the quote was still valid That was my only question I had already answered all the questions on the last call and by this time Mr ** was very rude Mr ** came back to the phone and stated his manager they were declining to write me I only had a quote I asked why I then asked to speak to his manager His manager Mr Eric ** came on the phone and was equally rude and he started to demand for me to say unequivocally if I would have my license in days I him that I hoped so and this good enough for him and he suddenly blurted out they were declining to write me My entire family is with and I understand how a call regarding a quote turned into this These guys were trying to sabotage me point blank It was nothing but sabotage I called back and spoke to a man named John and explained to him what happened and he pulled up my information and   Oh yeah we write you until you your license    but I needed the SR to the license and it was already approved until they angry I asked to speak to a manager and he he have one I know people working at and they all have managers I then asked for the number to the corporate office and he he     feel comfortable giving that to me   and then stated   you are on Google pull it up on the internet    I was shocked at not only his behavior but the behavior of Mr Dan ** and Mr Eric ** They seemed like the customers matter at all I hung up and called back and spoke to Chandra ** who seemed genuinely appalled at how I was treated and apologized but she sent me right back to Eric When I spoke again to Eric he changed his tune and they would   work with me   and that he simply wanted me to give affirmation I would have my license in days I was still shocked they were   demanding   to know this as the very first agent who I spoke to simply stated it and left it at that I him yes Then he   Well I am running your motor report from Tenneseee to make sure nothing else had come up    This was the weirdest customer experience I had ever had with an company He me he worked the Texas region but he took such an interest in me to run my report again to   double check   even though it was for Tennessee This was nothing but sabotage and harassment and intimidation nothing more or less I believe is letting people like this rule the roost I put a complaint on Facebook as well and my complaint was of dozens I saw all regarding customer service I need to speak to someone about this My entire family is covered with and I am ready to tell them all to cancel their policies and go elsewhere No company employee should away with treating people like this and forcing people to have to file all their complaints online because no managers are available It has been two hours and I have called several times and no find the number to the corporate office or a manager spoken to several departments and several different agents This is unbelievably terrible customer service  
 I have Safeco Auto deducted monies from my account through an automated system and I notified Bank of America and they promised me I would have my monies returned Bank of America did not pay Safeco and paid My auto was not paid I had a lapse and paid a penalty Bank of America kept reassuring me that they would take care of all the fees and did not has not repaid me the monies that were deducted from my account Lastly Safeco has been given all of the documentation of fraud on my bank account and also it is a bank error Safeco still has not rectified the situation  
 My was totaled this week after insured failed to yield at an intersection for which she received a ticket did not contact me the owner but not the driver until three days later to tell me that they are denying the claim because the   witness   who was partial as she was a passenger in their insured's that it was not their fault I find this bogus Additionally I learned that this particular adjuster only reviewed my claim for less than three hours before making a decision to deny the claim I expect this in writing soon and be filing my complaints also with the commissioner I believe this to be unfair settlement practices As a productive member of society I do not have time to be stonewalled by a company without a legitimate clause Furthermore not sure how you deny a claim on speculation that does not coincide with a police report My advice Seek a better company  
 I had my parked damaged by a client The claims service was unprofessional at best I received two estimates that were in difference from two separate repair businesses in two different cities I had to take my to a adjuster that was rude and unprofessional The amount was third of the other two estimates I want after market parts on my or feathering of the paint process as described by adjuster I took it to the closest repair shop to my home After dropping it off I called the adjuster and let them know Nine days later they went over and I was that is when the loss of use of my would take place nine days later I complained to upper management and they wanted to start it two days after I dropped it off as that is when they were notified I him no I had called the day I dropped if off and he later changed the loss of use date to when it was dropped off I was called on Monday two weeks later and was the was ready to be picked up I dropped off a new mud flap from Husky to be installed and they kept the day to do so Now only to pay for loss of use to the previous Friday instead of the Tuesday after the installation of the mud flap These adjusters operate in bad faith Unfortunately the accident was out of state and it is not worth my time to take their insured to small claims and force them to pay They know that Stay away from this company Your savings is not worth it  
 My father had for years and was completely satisfied so I began using as a young driver After years of good service recently turned into a pathetic company They only paid for after marketing parts in a minor collision on a one year old Their multi discount has practically vanished Their automated payments had once been perfect and suddenly became loaded with errors double billings no billings and strange dollar amount billings They corrected the problems but not until many phone calls letters and certified letters later I changed my auto pay to monthly and linked it to a small prepaid card I bought for using with them my way of limiting excessive withdrawals of their erroneous withdrawals made multiple attempts against the card within minutes and triggered a security alert that locked the card I called and they agreed to stop the multiple payments Then I received a cancellation notice in the mail indicating my premium hadn't been paid Of course it had been paid and the duplicate entry was what had been eliminated Approximately days later I received cancellation notice in the mail despite numerous calls to to solve the problem I finally called and cancelled the entire policy by phone with a backup cancellation notice sent via certified mail The notice included a register of payments and indicated they actually owed me money for the excess withdrawals I cancelled the debit card so that no more payments could be withdrawn sent me cancellation notice and written threats to turn me over to collections but they couldn't I copied my certified letter to my state attorney general's office and the state commissioner's office They made sure I received a refund check from a month later My dad and I have a combined linear business duration of years with but I not do business with them again ever If I discover a mishap involves a insured I be photographing obtaining witness details insisting authorities document and file and so on I cannot trust Their little green mascot needs to go home  
 They not pay off lien to me A customer financed a with me After about months the caught fire which happened on June rd now August th I called the president of Tony Nicely at I also called Nancy ** at ** Terry ** at ** and Bob ** who referred me to a nasty ** named Darlene ** claims manager who hung up on me I know how much money you save with and the caveman and lizards but their customer service needs a complete overhaul I even buy from if it was free  
 They are thieves I only had for about a month They gave me a quote and I paid for six months in advance month later I did an inquiry for adding my son who lives in state I wanted an estimate for his automobile They withdrew funds almost double what I paid the six months coverage for out of my bank account without notifying me or without my authorization After I explained this to them they informed me that once authorized they have access to withdraw funds as needed per my agreement Guys this is not what I agreed to They explained I needed to provide proof my son was covered by policy They did not have any of his information nor did I ever an updated policy with his name on it Basically they took my money out of my account because I made an inquiry Unless you have excessive money in your account and you monitor you bank account daily I would not recommend giving access to your bank account under any circumstances They rob you blind  
 I have had with for many years I added a and as expected my rate went up I later sold that and took it off my They   upped   my rate by a month when I took the off The bad thing to me is I called them and asked for some help with the rate and why the rate went up when I rid of a They gave me some story about cancelling in the middle of the pay period and also because month two payments were made They took the money out of my account for two months and were only supposed to take out for one Their mistake Anyway they had a nonchalant attitude and did not seem to care if I leave or not I am with company half the price which is what I was paying to start with so sorry they seem to care I had never had a problem with them at all until now so sad  
 My sister was involved in a traffic accident with a customer and The customer rear ended my sister's twice at a traffic light which caused her to rear end the in front of her twice I submitted the police report to regarding the accident which clearly stated their customer was at fault of the accident and had a statement from the customer stating he's the cause of the accident claimant rep was very rude regarding handling the claim and only offered % of my sister's being towed and % of the other vehicle's damages I advise anyone who's involved in a traffic accident with a customer to have an attorney on hand before speaking with a rep regarding the claim  
 Earlier this spring after a hail storm in a nearby area I realized I was under insured with I added additional coverage at that time Two weeks later I was driving in part of the state and hail damage on my I turned in the claim The agent wanted the name and number of the people I had visited but they were not comfortable with me giving out their information to a stranger After that the rep I had to sign a waiver so they could research my cell phone and make sure I was in the area I claimed to be in during the storm I then received a letter from them telling me they also wanted copies of my bank and credit card statements from that time period so they could see what purchases I had made in the area of the storm to prove that I was really there At point the rep me he trying to be a ** or the grim reaper and if I comply have to drop me for failure to cooperate I spent almost whole day at work trying to work this out with them along with many evening phone calls and emails with corporate Quite honestly I have time for this for what they were supposedly to give me I cancelled my claim  
 I received an email from today stating that my policy has been canceled due to non payment I called them immediately to pay and was informed that they cannot issue a policy because I no longer meet their requirements I asked to speak to a supervisor and Brock supervisor me it him that the guidelines changed six months ago and unfortunately he help me He me to try back maybe in six months or so very upset because been with since with my old and with my current This was completely an oversight and I was prepared to pay the premium but allowed to I guess loyalty means nothing these days  
 I tried to issue an anti thief device for a discount and stated that there is no discount for the club I stated to them that the club is listed under their anti thief devices and they actually asked me to send a screen shot to them Naturally I asked   Can you not look under your own devices to see what is listed    Young lady to me no way

 I received the following letter from Thank you for your recent inquiry to obtain After carefully considering your application we have determined that it does not meet our current overall requirements We regret that we cannot accept your request for at this time This action has been taken for the following specific reason s Insufficient Driving Experience Since underwriting standards vary from company to another it is likely that an application from you would be acceptable to some other company The letter I replied with been driving trucks vans and SUVs since I was about when I received my driver's license and about to turn in a few days so not sure of this lack of driving experience thing never received any speeding ticket or traffic violation of any sorts so I apologize that a tad bit baffled at why I was declined currently insured under under someone else's policy and have been on her policy for some time now So either way is still to cover me if I happen to into an accident And as a rebuttal to your statement about other companies yes I have indeed received approved from other companies for I thought as a longtime customer you would value my business with you and try to keep me as a customer Sincerely a guy who wants to be treated with some common sense  
 I purchased a policy in NJ for my auto thinking I was saving money months later I received an email about renewal I looked at my card and to my surprise it’s a month policy I can’t say % for sure that was or wasn’t to me to be honest But I am pretty on top of that When I called customer service I was shocked to find this was the case Direct withdrawal was coming from my checking and asked if last payment was for the last month of policy or to renew I had no intention of renewing so I didn’t want that to happen After putting me on hold twice I could tell she didn’t know I was policy was paid in full and good for more weeks I a quote from Cure for a little more money but it was for one year policy When I called to give courtesy cancellation I was asked about balance due Such poor customer service people do not know what they are doing on the other end of that phone I would never recommend this company to anyone a very bad experience  
 I reported a claim for damage to my RV during a storm Two days later I received a voice mail from a claims adjuster stating I might not be covered due to the way my policy was written Repeated attempts to contact the adjuster were useless I finally called customer service to complain The next day the adjuster called me and stated there was no point in calling me back because the decision had been made and my claim had already been denied She refused to let me speak to her supervisor and was extremely rude Several calls to customer service over the next weeks were useless as I was a supervisor would call back but no ever did I finally called and them I would report them to every consumer site available if I a return phone call that day I finally a call and all I was an apology for the way I was treated but nothing more could be done Bottom line is when I took out the policy I was I had full coverage but when I had a claim all of a sudden I have coverage for that item They take your money but provide no coverage and terrible customer service Stay away from  
 I had a accident on August This happened in Orlando I was waiting for a red light and then a truck hit the back of my The other paid for my treatment but refused to let me do more therapy They to my lawyer that what I was enough My policy with was full cover paid part of my but they didn’t provide a Now I don’t have I am still having pain in my left shoulder and my leg My son was involved in this accident and he is pain too I didn’t do anything here because I thought what did was right But is not fair that they did not even try to me another as they say when I bought their I figure out that they were supposed to provide a after my accident but they didn’t do it What I want is to ask for help so they do what they are supposed to do  
 I had a past due balance I had made arrangements to pay with a personal debit card for the following week I went to sign up on a different policy and I was charged the past due balance instead of what the website had shown causing overage fees from my bank Had the website clearly stated the amount I would have never clicked 'Continue' In the past I had been double charged Do not trust these thieves  
 Claim not paid Our brick mailbox was destroyed by a driven by James on March The James was driving was insured with under the name Julia Ann ** a employee has been rude and given me the run around over and over again since the accident Finally they sent Todd ** out to take pictures and write the claim After his inspection of the accident site I received a check from and then on April th they called to say sending the check was a mistake and that they had stopped payment on the check Ann ** from says it be months before they determine if they pay for our mailbox She says she is not sure they are liable even though their client who is fully insured destroyed our mailbox She suggested I call my company and file a claim Please tell me that this is ridiculous Not only do I have a huge mess in my yard I have a make shift mailbox that keeps falling over so I my mail half of the time Would you please help me this resolved not help me On April th Casey called me She me she is Ann **'s supervisor During the conversation she she was sorry for my loss and sorry they had to stop payment on the check they sent me to replace my mailbox She me it was a mistake that they had sent the check She me they are investigating the claim at this time She also since the driver there was a phantom She GIECO would not be liable to pay for my mailbox that the phantom should pay not them I asked her if I could quote her on that and she me no I could only say that she they are investigating I have checked with two other companies and they both me if there is a phantom they treat it in the same manner as if the accident had been caused by a deer and their companies would pay the claim I am extremely frustrated with I the impression they have no intention of paying this claim We have currently insured and if I ever have a desire to change companies after this experience I would never call a agent to a quote The only positive thing I say about is they have darling commercials has horrible customer service telephone manners and from the experience I have had I would say they certainly do not pay claims in a timely manner if at all After several weeks and countless phone calls with I am yet to be paid for the mailbox that was destroyed by a young man whose was insured with I am not in a financial position to hire an attorney and I do not have extra money to replace my mailbox This seems to be a case of a giant company walking on and taking advantage of an individual I guess they think if they beat me long enough I give up I have filed a complaint with the state of Missouri Commission Consumer Affairs and I intend to file with the BBB  
 Here is my complaint I start this out by saying this has nothing to do whether my claim was paid or not It has to do with the customer service or lack thereof of your employees I sent an email to determine if I had an issue that would be covered by or if I would have to pay out of pocket Next thing I know has started a claim for me and called to let me know an adjuster would be calling me for an inspection appointment The adjuster that was assigned for the Brunswick and Saint Marys GA area was named Dawson ** I sent him pictures of my damage and he called me back and he didn’t need to come see it He to take it to a repair shop and an estimate that I was covered He added to call him back with the estimate and not to worry he was the guy with the checkbook I did as asked I tried to call and there’s no response I sent an email and there’s no response I had the repair shop fax the estimate to the fax number he provided me with Next the repair shop is telling me that a guy from named Max I never his full name was out looking at it So since I have left several emails for Dawson ** and several emails with absolutely no response I called the other contact I was given on my claim Natalie ** liability I say there is someone named Max looking at my and I would like him added to my list of contacts on my online claim That was ignored It has been weeks at this point I have yet to a response from emails and voice mails to Dawson ** I have yet to any contact info on Max and I have yet to see a written estimate or see added to my online claim Now out of the blue submits an additional claim on top of my other one Lo and behold the phone rings He introduces himself as Dawson ** and he would like to come take a look at the damage on a claim that showed up on his system I tell him who I am and I haven’t submitted a claim and I am still waiting on something from my original claim He remembers me and says   Oh I thought your claim was already taken care of    I “Well if you had returned my calls in the past weeks you would see it was not ” I him that by looking online I see that Natalie ** submitted the second claim His response   What are you talking to her for You should only be talking to me ” I again him that I have left him messages I also him that someone named Max was the inspecting my He says   Let me call you back in minutes I have to chew some butt about this ” I never received call from him again Again I have left voice and emails with no response So I think to my self that he really is blowing me off I decided to call him from a different phone Guess what He answered So how is it I call him numerous times from my phone and never an answer and the time I use a different phone he picks up This is terrible service I drop based solely on having to deal with these Now I have discovered that Natalie has pawned me off to someone else I think both these two have buried themselves in a hole and it is better to ignore the customer than provide service Long story short they have no problem taking your money for years but not lift a single finger when it comes to the service they should be providing I would like nothing less than these two people fired unless of course this is how operates  
 I was rear ended by a insured driver whose BMW went underneath my Jeep damaging their My trailer hitch took the brunt of the impact I had my foot depressed on the clutch and my medical meniscus was torn and needs repair local office manager denies my claim because my had no visible damage but yet my trailer hitch is being replaced by Really to have to an accident attorney Bad business shame on a uni lateral decision by a manager trying to make the bottom line better for himself rather than doing what is right and what the other driver pays for

 I called today as a well meaning customer bringing business to the company in which my family and I have been with for years We have had a one million dollar umbrella policy with and are a preferred customer under my father’s name Michael ** As a family add on for my Civic I decided to go with and set up an auto policy I spoke with a young lady by the name of Lacie on speaker phone while my father and girlfriend happened to be in the room as well My father decided to speak with Lacie also helping me understand the different types of policy due to that fact that he is more experienced with the company than I After which Lacie then decided it was appropriate to tell me twenty one years old and then proceeded to say I should have been a man from years of age and called her on my own No offense but having my girlfriend in the room hearing someone from your sales department attempt to belittle me in such a short sighted way I think we both agree that probably it the best way to help represent your company through my eyes I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor who helped me out one hundred and ten percent and very grateful for that I appreciate everything you do as an excellent provider and I know you only want the best for your customers You guys have a great advertisement campaign aimed at sustaining your revenues also why you have this consumer affairs complaint section on your website And here taking the time to tell you that what occurred today in my opinion is unacceptable My dad and I both agreed we would not continue using your services if we had to deal with someone like Lacie again I call up a company whom I pay my hard earned money for protection comfort and a piece of mind to demoralized as sure you understand It’s obscene and offensive and I would like this to resolved immediately Thank you and goodbye  
 With the economy the way it is I check around for quotes whenever my period begins again I checked five companies and charged the least I was glad of that because I had been insured by in the past Imagine my surprise when I was assessed an extra amount once my policy was enforced which actually took my premium well past the other four quotes I called and there was apparently no reason for the assessment but I was that I could lower my bill if I took defensive driving lessons even though I had no tickets or accidents on my record I cancelled the policy and not insure with in the future I find this practice absolutely unethical  
 When I bought a new I asked questions Your employees have bad attitude and would not explain anything to me This happened on different occasions with different people I have now found an company who take time and explain things when asked

 My wife fell in love with the Gekko on their advertisements so I ordered a t shirt with a picture of the gekko on it and saved it for her for Christmas as a gift to her from our pets I ordered an extra large and received a large and failed to notice it After she received it she it should be an extra large so I contacted and they to return it for the right size My wife since I was to return it an XXL because she likes it very loose I called back and they that the XXL was an extra charge but they would waive it for me I sent it back to exchange it and it back three weeks later with a letter saying there was a day return policy and that I had exceeded that I paid to return it as agreed with and still have the wrong size that I originally which is of no use is obviously not customer oriented when it comes to the exchange of a lousy t shirt I hate to imagine how they would handle a claim  
 On December I called to pay my policy renewal which was due on December in the amount of The amount was deducted from my bank account On December my bank called to let me know my account was overdrawn in the amount of Knowing this information was incorrect I requested a statement of my account from the bank In reviewing the statement I observed on December a check in the amount of had also been paid to I immediately called customer service to inquire about the additional payment and was they had received an additional payment of and was in the process of refunding the check that very same day After not receiving the check by today I called the customer service again today to let them know I had not received the check and was that the check was mailed today I asked the agent to credit the money back to my account She could not do that When I asked why not she says they had to abide by the California Law that regulates I am very disappointed in the way treat their customers

 While calling a claim in I kept rerouted and sent to different people Finally after about the seventh person I was back at the person I started with It took over an hour to things sorted out While the coverage types they have are pretty good and inclusive it costs almost twice as much as other companies I have talked to for the same policy The people I talked to were very snippy and always were in a rush to me off the phone If I understand something or wanted more information on something they would huffy and explain in the least amount of information as possible or they would say that I need it  
 The folks at are very nice for sure but hard to a straight answer or a call back when they immediately answer the question The coverage seems alright and there are a handful of choices however when I thought I had signed up with full apparently some things included so that had to be changed later on when I realized I completely covered kept trying to raise my rates based on a national mileage average I had to document and submit my mileage several times over a year until they finally believed that I live in a small landlocked town and left me alone about it I thrilled about being transferred so much but I thought the reps at were generally well spoken professional and upbeat which seems unique
